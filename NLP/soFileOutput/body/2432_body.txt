<p>Have you ever seen any of there error messages?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-- SQL Server 2000</p>
  
  <p>Could not allocate ancillary table for view or function resolution.<br>
  The maximum number of tables in a query (256) was exceeded.</p>
  
  <p>-- SQL Server 2005</p>
  
  <p>Too many table names in the query. The maximum allowable is 256.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If yes, what have you done?</p>

<p>Given up? Convinced the customer to simplify their demands? Denormalized the database?</p>

<p>@(everyone wanting me to post the query):</p>

<ol>
<li>I'm not sure if I can paste 70 kilobytes of code in the answer editing window.</li>
<li>Even if I can this this won't help since this 70 kilobytes of code will reference 20 or 30 views that I would also have to post since otherwise the code will be meaningless.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't want to sound like I am boasting here but the problem is not in the queries. The queries are optimal (or at least almost optimal). I have spent countless hours optimizing them, looking for every single column and every single table that can be removed. Imagine a report that has 200 or 300 columns that has to be filled with a single SELECT statement (because that's how it was designed a few years ago when it was still a small report).</p>
