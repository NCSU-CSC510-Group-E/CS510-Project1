<p>What is the meaning of the <em>Java warning</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Type safety: The cast from Object to List is actually checking against the erased type List</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get this warning when I try to cast an Object to a type with generic information, such as in the following code:</p>

<pre><code>Object object = getMyList();
List&lt;Integer&gt; list = (List&lt;Integer&gt;) object;
</code></pre>
