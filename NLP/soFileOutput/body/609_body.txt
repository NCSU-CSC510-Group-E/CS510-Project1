<p>An MFC application that I'm trying to migrate uses <code>afxext.h</code>, which causes <code>_AFXDLL</code> to get set, which causes this error if I set <code>/MT</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please use the /MD switch for _AFXDLL builds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My research to date indicates that it is impossible to build an application for execution on Windows NT 4.0 using Visual Studio (C++, in this case) 2005.</p>

<p>Is this really true? Are there any workaround available?</p>
