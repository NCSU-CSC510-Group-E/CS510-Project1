<p>I need to copy hundreds of gigs of random files around on my computer and am pretty leery of using the vanilla file copy built into Windows.</p>

<p>I don't want it to hang on a "Are you sure?", "Are you really sure?", "Even zip files?", "Surely not read-only files too!" loop as soon as I step away.</p>

<p>I don't want it to work for hours and then stop unexpectedly: "Someone once opened this file and so I won't copy it!" and then cancel the whole copy or just quit with no indication of what was done and what work remains.</p>

<p>What file management programs do you have experience with?  Which do you recommend?</p>

<p>This question is related to my other question: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/225/how-can-i-use-an-old-pata-hard-disk-drive-on-my-newer-sata-only-computer">How can I use an old PATA hard disk drive on my newer SATA-only computer?</a></p>
