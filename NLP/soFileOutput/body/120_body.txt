Has anyone got experience creating SQL-based ASP.NET site-map providers?

I've got the default XML file web.sitemap working properly with my Menu and SiteMapPath controls, but I'll need a way for the users of my site to create and modify pages dynamically.

I need to tie page viewing permissions into the standard ASP.NET membership system as well.
