<p>For instance, my query is like the following using SQL Server 2005:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Table WHERE FREETEXT(SearchField, 'c#') 
</code></pre>

<p>I have a full text index defined to use the column SearchField which returns results when using:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Table WHERE SearchField LIKE '%c#%'
</code></pre>

<p>I believe # is a special letter, so how do I allow FREETEXT to work correctly for the query above?</p>
