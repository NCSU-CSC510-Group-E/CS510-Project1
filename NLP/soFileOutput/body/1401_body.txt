<p>I have a custom validation function in JavaScript in a user control on a .Net 2.0 web site which checks to see that the fee paid is not in excess of the fee amount due. </p>

<p>I've placed the validator code in the ascx file, and I have also tried using <code>Page.ClientScript.RegisterClientScriptBlock()</code> and in both cases the validation fires, but cannot find the JavaScript function.</p>

<p>The output in Firefox's error console is "feeAmountCheck is not defined". Here is the function (this was taken directly from firefox->view source)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    function feeAmountCheck(source, arguments)
    {
        var amountDue = document.getElementById('ctl00_footerContentHolder_Fees1_FeeDue');
        var amountPaid = document.getElementById('ctl00_footerContentHolder_Fees1_FeePaid');

        if (amountDue.value &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; amountDue &gt;= amountPaid)
        {
            arguments.IsValid = true;
        }
        else
        {
            arguments.IsValid = false;
        }

        return arguments;
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas as to why the function isn't being found? How can I remedy this without having to add the function to my master page or consuming page?</p>
