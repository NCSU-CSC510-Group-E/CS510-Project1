<p>At what point does a MySQL database start to lose performance?</p>

<ul>
<li>Does physical database size matter?</li>
<li>Do number of records matter?</li>
<li>Is any performance degradation linear or exponential?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have what I believe to be a large database, with roughly 15M records which take up almost 2GB. Based on these numbers, is there any incentive for me to clean the data out, or am I safe to allow it to continue scaling for a few more years?</p>
