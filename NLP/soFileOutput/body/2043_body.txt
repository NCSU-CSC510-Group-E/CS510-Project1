<p>A Windows exe file has access to the command string which invoked it, including its path and filename. eg. <code>C:\MyApp\MyApp.exe --help</code>.</p>

<p>But this is not so for a dll invoked via <code>LoadLibrary</code>. Does anyone know of a way for a dll to find out what its path and filename is?</p>

<p>Specifically I'm interested in a Delphi solution, but I suspect that the answer would be pretty much the same for any language.</p>
