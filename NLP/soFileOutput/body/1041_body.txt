<p>I'm looking for a robust, easy-to-use, regular expression evaluator for native C++, either platform-independent or Windows-specific.</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can't use Boost or ACE regex libraries (unfortunately)</li>
<li>Can't use .NET Regex (or any managed code)</li>
</ul>

<p>The main requirement is that it should be standalone and open.</p>
