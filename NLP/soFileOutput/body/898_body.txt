<p>How have you implemented Internationalization (i18n) in actual projects you've worked on?</p>

<p>I took an interest in making software cross-cultural after I read the famous post by Joel, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html" rel="noreferrer">The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)</a>. However, I have yet to able to take advantage of this in a real project, besides making sure I used Unicode strings where possible. But making all your strings Unicode and ensuring you understand what encoding everything you work with is in is just the tip of the i18n iceberg.</p>

<p>Everything I have worked on to date has been for use by a controlled set of US English speaking people, or i18n just wasn't something we had time to work on before pushing the project live. So I am looking for any tips or war stories people have about making software more localized in real world projects.</p>
