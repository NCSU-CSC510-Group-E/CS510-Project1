<p>What is the fastest, yet secure way to encrypt passwords in (PHP preferred), and for which ever method you choose is it portable?</p>

<p>In other words if I later migrate my website to a different server will my passwords continue to work?</p>

<p>The method I am using now as I was told is dependent on the exact versions of the libraries installed on the server.</p>
