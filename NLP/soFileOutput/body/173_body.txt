<p>I want to get my databases under version control.  Does anyone have any advice or recommended articles to get me started?</p>

<p>I'll always want to have at least <em>some</em> data in there (as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/80/alumb">alumb</a> mentions: user types and administrators).  I'll also often want a large collection of generated test data for performance measurements.</p>
