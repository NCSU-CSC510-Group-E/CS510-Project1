<p>You have an ascending list of numbers, what is the most efficient algorithm you can think of to get the ascending list of sums of every two numbers in that list.  Duplicates in the resulting list are irrelevant, you can remove them or avoid them if you like.</p>

<p>To be clear, I'm interested in the algorithm.  Feel free to post code in any language and paradigm that you like.</p>
