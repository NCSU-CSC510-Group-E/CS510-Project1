<p>I don't remember whether I was dreaming or not but I seem to recall there being a function which allowed something like,</p>

<pre><code>foo in iter_attr(array of python objects, attribute name)</code></pre>

<p>I've looked over the docs but this kind of thing doesn't fall under any obvious listed headers</p>
