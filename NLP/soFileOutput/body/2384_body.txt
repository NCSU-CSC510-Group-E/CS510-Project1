<p>I'm trying to read binary data using C#. I have all information about the layout of the data in the files I want to read. I'm able to read the data "chunk by chunk", i.e. getting the first 40 bytes of data converting it to a string, get the next 40 bytes, ...</p>

<p>Since there are at least three slightly different version of the data, I would like to read the data directly into a struct. It just feels so much more right than by reading it "line by line".</p>

<p>I have tried the following approach but to no avail:</p>

<pre><code>StructType aStruct;
int count = Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(StructType));
byte[] readBuffer = new byte[count];
BinaryReader reader = new BinaryReader(stream);
readBuffer = reader.ReadBytes(count);
GCHandle handle = GCHandle.Alloc(readBuffer, GCHandleType.Pinned);
aStruct = (StructType) Marshal.PtrToStructure(handle.AddrOfPinnedObject(), typeof(StructType));
handle.Free();
</code></pre>

<p>The stream is an opened FileStream from which I have began to read from. I get an AccessViolationException when using Marshal.PtrToStructure.</p>

<p>The stream contains more information than I'm trying to read since I'm not interested in data at the end of the file.</p>

<p>The struct is defined like:</p>

<pre><code>[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)]
struct StructType
{
    [FieldOffset(0)]
    public string FileDate;
    [FieldOffset(8)]
    public string FileTime;
    [FieldOffset(16)]
    public int Id1;
    [FieldOffset(20)]
    public string Id2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The examples code is changed from original to make this question shorter.</p>

<p>How would I read binary data from a file into a struct?</p>
