<p>I am using the Photoshop's javascript API to find the fonts in a given PSD.</p>

<p>Given a font name returned by the API, I want to find the actual physical font file that font name corresponds to on the disc.</p>

<p>This is all happening in a python program running on OSX so I guess I'm looking for one of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some Photoshop javascript</li>
<li>A Python function</li>
<li>An OSX API that I can call from python</li>
</ul>
