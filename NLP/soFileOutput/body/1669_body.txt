<p><em>Preferred languages</em>: C/C++, Java, and Ruby.</p>

<p>I am looking for some helpful books/tutorials on how to write your own compiler simply for educational purposes. I am most familiar with C/C++, Java, and Ruby, so I prefer resources that involve one of those three, but any good resource is acceptable.</p>
