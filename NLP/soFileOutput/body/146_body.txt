<p>I have a website that plays mp3s in a flash player. If a user clicks 'play' the flash player automatically downloads an mp3 and starts playing it. </p>

<p>Is there an easy way to track how many times a particular song clip (or any binary file) has been downloaded?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the play link a link to the actual
  mp3 file or to some javascript code
  that pops up a player?</p>
  
  <p>If the latter, you can easily add your
  own logging code in there to track the
  number of hits to it.</p>
  
  <p>If the former, you'll need something
  that can track the web server log
  itself and make that distinction. My
  hosting plan comes with webalizer,
  which does this nicely.</p>

<p>It's javascript code, so that answers that. </p>

<p>However, it would be nice to know how to track downloads using the other method (without switching hosts).</p>
