<p>I've got a menu in Python. That part was easy. I'm using <code>raw_input()</code> to get the selection from the user. </p>

<p>The problem is that <code>raw_input</code> (and input) require the user to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> after they make a selection. Is there any way to make the program act immediately upon a keystroke? Here's what I've got so far:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
print """Menu
1) Say Foo
2) Say Bar"""
answer = raw_input("Make a selection&gt; ")

if "1" in answer: print "foo"
elif "2" in answer: print "bar"
</code></pre>

<p>It would be great to have something like</p>

<pre><code>print menu
while lastKey = "":
    lastKey = check_for_recent_keystrokes()
if "1" in lastKey: #do stuff...
</code></pre>
