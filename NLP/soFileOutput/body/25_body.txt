<p>I've been having issues getting the C sockets API to work properly in C++. Specifically, although I am including <code>sys/socket.h</code>, I still get compile time errors telling me that <code>AF_INET</code> is not defined. Am I missing something obvious, or could this be related to the fact that I'm doing this coding on <code>z/OS</code> and my problems are much more complicated?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Upon further investigation, I discovered that there is an <code>#ifdef</code> that I'm hitting. Apparently <code>z/OS</code> isn't happy unless I define which "type" of sockets I'm using with:</p>

<pre><code>#define _OE_SOCKETS
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I personally have no idea what this <code>_OE_SOCKETS</code> is actually for, so if any <code>z/OS</code> sockets programmers are out there (all 3 of you), perhaps you could give me a rundown of how this all works?</p>

<hr>

<p>Sure I can post a test app.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

int main()
{
    return AF_INET;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compile/Link Output:</p>

<p>cxx -Wc,xplink -Wl,xplink -o inet_test inet.C</p>

<p>"./inet.C", line 5.16: CCN5274 (S) The name lookup for "AF_INET" did not find a declaration.</p>

<p>CCN0797(I) Compilation failed for file ./inet.C. Object file not created.</p>

<p>A check of sys/sockets.h does include the definition I need, and as far as I can tell, it is not being blocked by any #ifdef statements.</p>

<p>I have however noticed it contains a the following:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef __cplusplus
  extern "C" {
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>which encapsulates basically the whole file. Not sure if it matters.</p>
