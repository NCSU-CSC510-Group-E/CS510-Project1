<p>I'm not sure what the correct size should be.</p>

<p>Many sites seem to repeat that the apple-touch-icon should be 57x57 pixels but cite a broken link as their source.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MakeYourWebsiteMobileAndIPhoneFriendlyAddHomeScreenIPhoneIconsAndAdjustTheViewPort.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Hanselman</a>'s and <a href="http://playgroundblues.com/posts/2008/jan/15/iphone-bookmark-iconage/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">playgroundblues</a>'s comments suggest different sizes including 163x163 and 60x60.</p>

<p>Apple's own <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-touch-icon.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">apple.com icon</a> is 129x129!</p>
