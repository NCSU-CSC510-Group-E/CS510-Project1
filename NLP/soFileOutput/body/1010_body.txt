<p>I need to grab the base64-encoded representation of the ViewState. Obviously this would not be available until fairly late in the request lifecycle, which is OK.</p>

<p>For example, if the output of the page includes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE" 
  id="__VIEWSTATE" value="/wEPDwUJODU0Njc5MD...==" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I need a way on the server side to get the value <code>"/wEPDwUJODU0Njc5MD...=="</code></p>

<p>To clarify, I need this value when the page is being rendered, not on PostBack. e.g. I need to know the ViewState value that is being <em>sent</em> to the client, not the ViewState I'm getting back from them.</p>
