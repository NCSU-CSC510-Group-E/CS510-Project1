<p>Is there a way of mapping data collected on a stream or array to a data structure or vice-versa?
In C++ this would simply be a matter of casting a pointer to the stream as a data type I want to use (or vice-versa for the reverse)
eg: in C++</p>

<pre><code>Mystruct * pMyStrct = (Mystruct*)&amp;SomeDataStream;
pMyStrct-&gt;Item1 = 25;

int iReadData = pMyStrct-&gt;Item2;
</code></pre>

<p>obviously the C++ way is pretty unsafe unless you are sure of the quality of the stream data when reading incoming data, but for outgoing data is super quick and easy.</p>
