<p>I have a database table and one of the fields (not the primary key) is having a unique index on it. Now I want to swap values under this column for two rows. How could this be done? Two hacks I know are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete both rows and re-insert them</li>
<li>Update rows with some other value
and swap and then update to actual value.</li>
</ol>

<p>But I don't want to go for these as they do not seem to be the appropriate solution to the problem.
Could anyone help me out?</p>
