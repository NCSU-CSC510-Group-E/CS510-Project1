<p>I am working on a collection of classes used for video playback and recording. I have one main class which acts like the public interface, with methods like <code>play()</code>, <code>stop()</code>, <code>pause()</code>, <code>record()</code> etc... Then I have workhorse classes which do the video decoding and video encoding. </p>

<p>I just learned about the existence of nested classes in C++, and I'm curious to know what programmers think about using them. I am a little wary and not really sure what the benefits/drawbacks are, but they seem (according to the book I'm reading) to be used in cases such as mine.</p>

<p>The book suggests that in a scenario like mine, a good solution would be to nest the workhorse classes inside the interface class, so there are no separate files for classes the client is not meant to use, and to avoid any possible naming conflicts? I don't know about these justifications. Nested classes are a new concept to me. Just want to see what programmers think about the issue.</p>
