<p>I'm trying to setup CruiseControl.net at the moment. So far it works nice, but I have a Problem with the MSBuild Task.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/MsBuild+Task" rel="noreferrer">Documentation</a>, it passes CCNetArtifactDirectory to MSBuild. But how do I use it?</p>

<p>I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;buildArgs&gt;
   /noconsolelogger /p:OutputPath=$(CCNetArtifactDirectory)\test
&lt;/buildArgs&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But that does not work. In fact, it kills the service with this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Core.Config.Preprocessor.EvaluationException: Reference to unknown symbol CCNetArtifactDirectory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Documentation is rather sparse, and google und mainly offers modifying the .sln Project file, which is what I want to avoid in order to be able to manually build this project later - I would really prefer <code>/p:OutputPath</code>.</p>
