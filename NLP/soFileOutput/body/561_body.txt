<p>I would like to test a function with a tuple from a set of fringe cases and normal values. For example, while testing a function which returns <code>true</code> whenever given three lengths that form a valid triangle, I would have specific cases, negative / small / large numbers, values close-to being overflowed, etc.; what is more, main aim is to generate combinations of these values, <em>with</em> or <em>without</em> repetition, in order to get a set of test data.</p>

<pre><code>(inf,0,-1), (5,10,1000), (10,5,5), (0,-1,5), (1000,inf,inf),
...
</code></pre>
