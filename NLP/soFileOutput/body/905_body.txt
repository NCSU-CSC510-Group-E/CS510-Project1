<p>We're upgrading an existing program from <code>Win2k/SQL Server 2k</code> to <code>Windows 2003 and SQL Server 2005</code> as well as purchasing a new program that also uses <code>2k3/2k5</code>. The vendor says that for us to host both databases we need to get the Enterprise version because the softwares clients use different collation for the connections and only Enterprise supports this.</p>

<p>I cannot find anything on MS's site to support this and, honestly, don't want to pay the extra for Enterprise if the Standard edition works. Am I missing some not talked about feature of SQL Server or is this, as I suspect, a vendor trying to upsell me?</p>
