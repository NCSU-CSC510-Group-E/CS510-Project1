<p>I have values stored as strings in a <code>DataTable</code> where each value could really represent an <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, or <code>string</code> (they were all converted to strings during an import process from an external data source). I need to test and see what type each value really is.</p>

<p>What is more efficient for the application (or is there no practical difference)?</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to convert to <code>int</code> (and then <code>double</code>). If conversion works, the return <code>true</code>. If an exception is thrown, return <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Regular expressions designed to match the pattern of an <code>int</code> or <code>double</code></li>
<li>Some other method?</li>
</ol>
