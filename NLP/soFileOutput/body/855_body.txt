<p>Is there an easy way to produce MSDN-style documentation from the Visual Studio XML output?<br>
I'm not patient enough to set up a good xslt for it because I know I'm not the first person to cross this bridge.  </p>

<p>Also, I tried setting up sandcastle recently, but it really made my eyes cross.  Either I was missing something important in the process or it is just way too involved.</p>

<p>I know somebody out there has a really nice dead-simple solution.</p>

<p>I'm reiterating here because I think my formatting made that paragraph non-inviting to read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I gave sandcastle a try but had a really hard time getting it set up.
  What I really have in mind is something much simpler.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, unless I just don't understand the sandcastle process.  It seemed like an awful lot of extra baggage to me just to produce something nice for the testers to work with.</p>
