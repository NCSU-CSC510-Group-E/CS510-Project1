<p>The <code>.XFDL</code> file extension identifies <code>XFDL</code> Formatted Document files. These belong to the XML-based document and template formatting standard. This format is exactly like the XML file format however, contains a level of encryption for use in secure communications.</p>

<p>I know how to view XFDL files using a file viewer I found <a href="http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/viewerdownload.asp" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.  I can also modify and save these files by doing File:Save/Save As.  I'd like, however, to modify these files on the fly. Any suggestions? Is this even possible?</p>

<p>Update #1: I have now successfully decoded and unziped a <code>.xfdl</code> into an XML file which I can then edit. Now, I am looking for a way to re-encode the modified XML file back into base64-gzip (using Ruby or the command line)</p>
