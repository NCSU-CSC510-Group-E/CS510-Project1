<p>I have come across a lot of optimization tips which say that you should mark your classes as sealed to get extra performance benefits.</p>

<p>I ran some tests to check the performance differential and found none. Am I doing something wrong? Am I missing the case where sealed classes will give better results?</p>

<p>Has anyone run tests and seen a difference?</p>

<p>Help me learn :)</p>
