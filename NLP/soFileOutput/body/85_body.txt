What are your best practices around creating flat file database structures in PHP?  A lot of the more mature PHP flat file frameworks I see out there attempt to implement SQL-like query syntax, which is over the top for my purposes in most cases (I would just use a database at that point).

Are there any elegant tricks out there to get good performance and features with the small code overhead one would want by taking on this problem in the first place?
