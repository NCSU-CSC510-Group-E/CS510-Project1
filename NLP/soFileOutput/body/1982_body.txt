<p>I was just wondering if there is an elegant way to set the maximum CPU load for a particular thread doing intensive calculations. 
<br/><br/>Right now I have located the most time consuming loop in the thread (it does only compression) and use <code>GetTickCount()</code> and <code>Sleep()</code> with hardcoded values. It makes sure that the loop continues for a certain period of time and than sleeps for a certain minimal time. It more or less does the job i.e. guarantees that the thread will not use more than 50% of CPU. <br>However behavior is dependent on the number of CPU cores (huge disadvantage) and simply ugly (smaller disadvantage :)). <br>Any ideas?</p>
