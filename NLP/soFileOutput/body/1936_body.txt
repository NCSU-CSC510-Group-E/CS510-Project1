<p>Using ASP.NET MVC there are situations (such as form submission) that may require a <code>RedirectToAction</code>.  </p>

<p>One such situation is when you encounter validation errors after a form submission and need to redirect back to the form, but would like the URL to reflect the URL of the form, not the action page it submits to.</p>

<p>As I require the form to contain the originally <code>POST</code>ed data, for user convenience, as well as validation purposes, how can I pass the data through the <code>RedirectToAction()</code>?  If I use the viewData parameter, my <code>POST</code> parameters will be changed to <code>GET</code> parameters.</p>
