<p>In Windows, in any windows form or web browser, you can use the tab button to switch focus through all of the form fields. </p>

<p>It will stop on textboxes, radiobuttons, checkboxes, dropdown menus, etc. </p>

<p>However, in Mac OSX, tab skips dropdown menus. Is there anyway to change this behavior, or access the above items mentioned, without using a mouse?</p>
