<p>I'd like to create a progress bar to indicate the status of an a batch job in <code>Ruby</code>. </p>

<p>I've read some <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/" rel="noreferrer" title="NCURSES Programming HOWTO">tutorials</a> / <a href="http://ncurses-ruby.berlios.de/" rel="noreferrer" title="ncurses-ruby">libraries</a> on using <em>(n)curses</em>, none of which were particularly helpful in explaining how to create an <em>"animated"</em> progress bar in the terminal or using curses with <code>Ruby</code>. </p>

<p>I'm already aware of using a separate thread to monitor the progress of a given job, I'm just not sure how to proceed with drawing a progress bar. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>  </p>

<p><a href="http://0xcc.net/ruby-progressbar/" rel="noreferrer" title="ruby-progressbar">ProgressBar</a> class was incredibly straight-forward, perfectly solved my problem.</p>
