<p>I need to programmatically solve a system of linear equations in C, Objective C, or (if needed) C++.</p>

<p>Here's an example of the equations:</p>

<pre><code>-44.3940 = a * 50.0 + b * 37.0 + tx
-45.3049 = a * 43.0 + b * 39.0 + tx
-44.9594 = a * 52.0 + b * 41.0 + tx
</code></pre>

<p>From this, I'd like to get the best approximation for <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>tx</code>.</p>
