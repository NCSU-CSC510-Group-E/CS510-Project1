<p>I want to use a track-bar to change a form's opacity.</p>

<p>This is my code:</p>

<pre><code>decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000;
this.Opacity = trans;
</code></pre>

<p>When I build the application, it gives the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cannot implicitly convert type <code>'decimal'</code> to <code>'double'</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried using <code>trans</code> and <code>double</code> but then the control doesn't work. This code worked fine in a past VB.NET project.</p>
