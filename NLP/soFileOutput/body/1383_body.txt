<p>I saw many questions asking 'how' to unit test in a specific language, but no question asking 'what', 'why', and 'when'.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is it?</li>
<li>What does it do for me?</li>
<li>Why should I use it?</li>
<li>When should I use it (also when not)?</li>
<li>What are some common pitfalls and misconceptions</li>
</ul>
