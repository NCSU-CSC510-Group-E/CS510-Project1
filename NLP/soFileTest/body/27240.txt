In Java 5 and above you have the foreach loop, which works magically on anything that implements Iterable:

for (Object o : list) {
  doStuff(o);
}


However, Enumerable still does not implement Iterable, meaning that to iterate over an Enumeration you must do the following:

for(; e.hasMoreElements() ;) {
  doStuff(e.nextElement());
}


Does anyone know if there is a reason why Enumeration still does not implement Iterable?

Edit: As a clarification, I'm not talking about the language concept of an enum, I'm talking a Java-specific class in the Java API called 'Enumeration'.
