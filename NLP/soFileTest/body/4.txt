I want to use a track-bar to change a form's opacity.

This is my code:

decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000;
this.Opacity = trans;


When I build the application, it gives the following error:


  Cannot implicitly convert type 'decimal' to 'double'.


I tried using trans and double but then the control doesn't work. This code worked fine in a past VB.NET project.
