My JavaScript is pretty nominal, so when I saw this construction, I was kind of baffled:

var shareProxiesPref = document.getElementById("network.proxy.share_proxy_settings");
shareProxiesPref.disabled = proxyTypePref.value != 1;


Isn't it better to do an if on proxyTypePref.value, and then declare the var inside the result, only if you need it?

(Incidentally, I also found this form very hard to read in comparison to the normal usage. There were a set of two or three of these conditionals, instead of doing a single if with a block of statements in the result.)



UPDATE:

The responses were very helpful and asked for more context. The code fragment is from Firefox 3, so you can see the code here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/firefox/source/browser/components/preferences/connection.js

Basically, when you look at the Connect preferences window in Firefox, clicking the proxy modes (radio buttons), causes various form elements to enable|disable.
