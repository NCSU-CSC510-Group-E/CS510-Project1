I have a large database of normalized order data that is becoming very slow to query for reporting.  Many of the queries that I use in reports join five or six tables and are having to examine tens or hundreds of thousands of lines.

There are lots of queries and most have been optimized as much as possible to reduce server load and increase speed.  I think it's time to start keeping a copy of the data in a denormalized format.

Any ideas on an approach?  Should I start with a couple of my worst queries and go from there?
