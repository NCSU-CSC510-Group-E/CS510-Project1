One simple method I've used in the past is basically just creating a second table whose structure mirrors the one I want to audit, and then create an update/delete trigger on the main table.  Before a record is updated/deleted, the current state is saved to the audit table via the trigger.

While effective, the data in the audit table is not the most useful or simple to report off of.  I'm wondering if anyone has a better method for auditing data changes?

There shouldn't be too many updates of these records, but it is highly sensitive information, so it is important to the customer that all changes are audited and easily reported on.
