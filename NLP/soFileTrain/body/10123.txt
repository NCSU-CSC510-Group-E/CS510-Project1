I'm trying to decode the result of the Python os.wait() function. This returns, according to the Python docs:


  a tuple containing its pid and exit status indication: a 16-bit number, whose low byte is the signal number that killed the process, and whose high byte is the exit status (if the signal number is zero); the high bit of the low byte is set if a core file was produced.


How do I decode the exit status indication (which is an integer) to obtain the high and low byte? To be specific, how do I implement the decode function used in the following code snippet:

(pid,status) = os.wait()
(exitstatus, signum) = decode(status)
