I am looking for either a FireFox extension, or a similar program, that allows you to craft GET and POST requests. The user would put in a form action, and as many form key/value pairs as desired. It would also send any cookie information (or send the current cookies from any domain the user chooses.) The Web Developer add-on is almost what I'm looking for; It let's you quickly see the form keys, but it doesn't let you change them or add new ones (which leads to a lot of painful JavaScript in the address bar...)
