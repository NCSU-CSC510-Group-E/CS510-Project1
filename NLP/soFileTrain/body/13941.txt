I'd like to have a python program alert me when it has completed its task by making a beep noise.  Currently,  I use import os and then use a command line speech program to say "Process complete."  I much rather it be a simple "bell."

I know that there's a function that can be used in Cocoa apps, NSBeep, but I don't think that has much anything to do with this.

I've also tried print(\a) but that didn't work.

I'm using a Mac, if you couldn't tell by my Cocoa comment, so that may help.

Thanks!
