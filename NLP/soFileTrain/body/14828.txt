I work on quite a few DotNetNuke sites, and occasionally (I haven't figured out the common factor yet), when I use the Database Publishing Wizard from Microsoft to create scripts for the site I've created on my Dev server, after running the scripts at the host (usually GoDaddy.com), and uploading the site files, I get an error...  I'm 99.9% sure that it's not file related, so not sure where to begin in the DB.  Unfortunately with DotNetNuke you don't get the YSOD, but a generic error, with no real way to find the actual exception that has occured.

I'm just curious if anyone has had similar deployment issues using the Database Publishing Wizard, and if so, how they overcame them?  I own the RedGate toolset, but some hosts like GoDaddy don't allow you to direct connect to their servers...
