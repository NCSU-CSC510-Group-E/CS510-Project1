I'm looking to create a dashboard type gui for a web application.  I'm looking for the user to be able to drag and drop different elements (probably either image buttons, anchor tags, or maybe just divs) to different (defined) places and be able to save their setup (in a cookie or on the server).  I'm working with c# in the .Net 2.0 framework.  I've tried using mootools but their recent update has left their drag/drop capabilities un-useful for me.  I'm looking for a bit of direction because I know there is something out there that is just what I'm looking for so I wont have to build from scratch.

Thanks.
