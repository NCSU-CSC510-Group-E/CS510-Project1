This is a bit of a long shot, but if anyone can figure it out, you guys can...

In Windows XP, is there any meta-data that comes with a cut and paste action, from which I can ascertain the application that provided the clipboard contents?

Bonus question... if there is such information, is there any way I can access it through a Java app?
