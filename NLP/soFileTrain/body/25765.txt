I'm in the process of weeding out all hardcoded values in a Java library and was wondering what framework would be the best (in terms of zero- or close-to-zero configuration) to handle run-time configuration? I would prefer XML-based configuration files, but it's not essential. 

Please do only reply if you have practical experience with a framework. I'm not looking for examples, but experience...
