  Creating tempory folders  




I'm looking for something like the tempfile module in Python: A (preferably) secure way to open a file for writing to. This should be easy to delete when I'm done too...

It seems, .NET does not have the "batteries included" features of the tempfile module, which not only creates the file, but returns the file descriptor (old school, I know...) to it along with the path. At the same time, it makes sure only the creating user can access the file and whatnot (mkstemp() I think): https://docs.python.org/library/tempfile.html



Ah, yes, I can see that. But GetTempFileName does have a drawback: There is a race condition between when the file was created (upon call to GetTempFileName a 0-Byte file gets created) and when I get to open it (after return of GetTempFileName). This might be a security issue, although not for my current application...
