There are a few ways to get class-like behavior in javascript, the most common seem to be prototype based like this:

function Vector(x, y, x) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.z = z;
    return this;
}

Vector.prototype.length = function () { return Math.sqrt(this.x * this.x ... ); }


and closure based approaches similar to

function Vector(x, y, z) {
    this.length = function() { return Math.sqrt(x * x + ...); }
}


For various reasons the latter is faster, but I've seen (and I frequently do write) the prototype version and was curious as to what other people do.
