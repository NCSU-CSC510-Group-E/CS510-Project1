I'm using ColdFusion to populate a template that includes HTML lists (ul's).

Most of these aren't that long, but a few have ridiculously long lengths and could really stand to be in 2-3 columns.

Is there an HTML, ColdFusion or perhaps JavaScript (I have jQuery available) way to do this easily?  It's not worth some over-complicated heavy weight solution to save some scrolling.
