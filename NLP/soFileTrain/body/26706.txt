I'm a bit perplexed by drag and drop in wxPython (but perhaps this questions pertains to drag and drop in other GUI frameworks as well). The frameworks provides a couple of callbacks (OnEnter and OnDragOver) that purportedly allow me to inform the system whether the current mouse position is a valid place to drop whatever it is that is being dragged. From these methods I can return wx.DragNone, wx.DragCopy, etc. What baffles me is that from within these methods I am not allowed to call GetData, which means I am not allowed to examine the data that the user is dragging. If I cannot see the data, how am I supposed to know whether it is OK for the user to drop here?
