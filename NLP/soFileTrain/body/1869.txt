On the project that I am working on I have a couple of databases. Each table and each column in the database has a description set (as an extended property in SQL 2005). As a part of the documentation going to the client we need to produce a data dictionary showing all of the tables and columns along with a collection of meta data (data-type, optionality, constraints).

Is anyone using a tool to automatically create this kind of document? If so, which tools do you use? I have used Data Dictionary Creator which is awesome but it doesn't seem to do data types or optionality (unless you want to add in custom fields and fill them in yourself).
