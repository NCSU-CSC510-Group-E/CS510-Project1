I'm a moderately skilled programmer using JavaScript but I am no guru. I know you can do some pretty powerful things with it, I just haven't seen much other than fairly basic DOM manipulation. I'm wondering if people could provide some examples of traditional design pattern concepts such as Factory Method, Singleton, etc using JavaScript. In what cases would these patterns be used for on the web?
