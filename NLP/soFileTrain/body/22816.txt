I know the following libraries for drawing charts in an SWT/Eclipse RCP application:


Eclipse BIRT Chart Engine (Links to an article on how to use it)
JFreeChart


Which other libraries are there for drawing pretty charts with SWT? Or charts in Java generally? After all, you can always display an image...
