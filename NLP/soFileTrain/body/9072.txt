Question for YUI experts...

I have a table and I've made each cell of the first row draggable by proxy. In IE, when the drag proxy is released, the original table cell actually jumps to wherever the release point was. How can I prevent this from happening? Essentially, I want to know where the proxy was dropped and handle my logic from there but I don't want the original to move.
