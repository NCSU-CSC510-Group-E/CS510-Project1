After I was convinced that labeled breaks/continues are a total "nono" over here, I need help to remove the label out of my code.

I have a square matrix and a vector that has the same length. The vector has already some values in it an depending on the values in the matrix the vector is changed in the loop.

I hope, the code-fragment is basically understandableâ€¦ 

vectorLoop:
for( int idx = 0; idx  vectorLength; idx++) {
    if( conditionAtVectorPosition( v, idx ) ) continue vectorLoop;

    matrixLoop:
    for( rowIdx = 0; rowIdx  n; rowIdx++ ) {
        if( anotherConditionAtVector( v, rowIdx ) ) continue matrixLoop;
        if( conditionAtMatrixRowCol( m, rowIdx, idx ) ) continue vectorLoop;
    }
    setValueInVector( v, idx );
}     


Please convince me, that there is a more readable/better version without the labels.
