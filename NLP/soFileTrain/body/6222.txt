Is anyone successfully using the latest 64-bit Ganymede release of Eclipse on Windows XP or Vista 64-bit?

Currently I run the normal Eclipse 3.4 distribution on a 32bit JDK and launch  compile my apps with a 64bit JDK. Our previous experience has been that the 64bit Eclipse distro is unstable for us, so I'm curious if anyone is using it successfully.

We are using JDK 1.6.0_05.
