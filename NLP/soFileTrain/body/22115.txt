I am writing a Java utility which helps me to generate loads of data for performance testing.  It would be really cool to be able to specify a regex for Strings so that my generator spits out things which match this.  Is there something out there already baked which I can use to do this?  Or is there a library which gets me most of the way there?

Thanks
