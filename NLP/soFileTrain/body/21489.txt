SQL Experts,

Is there an efficient way to group runs of data together using SQL?
Or is it going to be more efficient to process the data in code.  

For example if I have the following data:

ID|Name
01|Harry Johns
02|Adam Taylor
03|John Smith
04|John Smith
05|Bill Manning
06|John Smith


I need to display this:

Harry Johns
Adam Taylor
John Smith (2)
Bill Manning
John Smith


@Matt: Sorry I had trouble formatting the data using an embedded html table it worked in the preview but not in the final display.
