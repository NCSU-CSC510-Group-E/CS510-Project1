If I have Python code

class A():
    pass
class B():
    pass
class C(A, B):
    pass


and I have class C, is there a way to iterate through it's super classed (A and B)? Something like pseudocode:

 magicGetSuperClasses(C)
(type 'A', type 'B')


One solution seems to be inspect module and getclasstree function.

def magicGetSuperClasses(cls):
    return [o[0] for o in inspect.getclasstree([cls]) if type(o[0]) == type]


but is this a "Pythonian" way to achieve the goal?
