I'm looking for a pattern for performing a dynamic search on multiple tables.

I have no control over the legacy (and poorly designed) database table structure.

Consider a scenario similar to a resume search where a user may want to perform a search against any of the data in the resume and get back a list of resumes that match their search criteria.  Any field can be searched at anytime and in combination with one or more other fields.

The actual sql query gets created dynamically depending on which fields are searched.  Most solutions I've found involve complicated if blocks, but I can't help but think there must be a more elegant solution since this must be a solved problem by now.



Yeah, so I've started down the path of dynamically building the sql in code.  Seems godawful.  If I really try to support the requested ability to query any combination of any field in any table this is going to be one MASSIVE set of if statements.  shiver



I believe I read that COALESCE only works if your data does not contain NULLs.  Is that correct?  If so, no go, since I have NULL values all over the place.
