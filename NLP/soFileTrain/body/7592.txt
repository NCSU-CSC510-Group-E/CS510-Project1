I want to create a client side mail creator web page. I know the problems of using the mailto action in an html form (not standard, no default mail appication set on the client). But the web page isn't very important, and they don't care very much.

The mail created by the mailto action has the syntax:


  subject: undefined subject
  body:
  
  param1=value1
  param2=value2
  .
  .
  .
  paramn=valuen  


Can I use JavaScript to format the mail like this?


  Subject:XXXXX
  
  Body:
  Value1;Value2;Value3...ValueN
