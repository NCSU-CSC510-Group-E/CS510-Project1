I've got a menu in Python. That part was easy. I'm using raw_input() to get the selection from the user. 

The problem is that raw_input (and input) require the user to press Enter after they make a selection. Is there any way to make the program act immediately upon a keystroke? Here's what I've got so far:

import sys
print """Menu
1) Say Foo
2) Say Bar"""
answer = raw_input("Make a selection ")

if "1" in answer: print "foo"
elif "2" in answer: print "bar"


It would be great to have something like

print menu
while lastKey = "":
    lastKey = check_for_recent_keystrokes()
if "1" in lastKey: #do stuff...
