Wondering if there is a better why in  the WHERE clause of choosing records when you need to look at effective start and end dates?

Currently this how I've done it in the past on MS SQL Server. Just worried about the date and not the time. I'm using SQL Server 2005.

AND Convert(datetime, Convert(char(10), ep.EffectiveStartDate, 101))
   = Convert(datetime, Convert(char(10), GetDate(), 101))
AND Convert(datetime, Convert(char(10), ep.EffectiveEndDate, 101))
   = Convert(datetime, Convert(char(10), GetDate(), 101))
