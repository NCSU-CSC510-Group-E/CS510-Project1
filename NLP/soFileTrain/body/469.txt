I am using the Photoshop's javascript API to find the fonts in a given PSD.

Given a font name returned by the API, I want to find the actual physical font file that font name corresponds to on the disc.

This is all happening in a python program running on OSX so I guess I'm looking for one of:


Some Photoshop javascript
A Python function
An OSX API that I can call from python
