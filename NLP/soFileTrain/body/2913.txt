Does anyone have some good hints for writing test code for database-backend development where there is a heavy dependency on state?

Specifically, I want to write tests for code that retrieve records from the database, but the answers will depend on the data in the database (which may change over time).

Do people usually make a separate development system with a 'frozen' database so that any given function should always return the exact same result set?

I am quite sure this is not a new issue, so I would be very interested to learn from other people's experience.

Are there good articles out there that discuss this issue of web-based development in general?

I usually write PHP code, but I would expect all of these issues are largely language and framework agnostic.
