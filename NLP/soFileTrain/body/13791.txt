I am trying to implement string unescaping with Python regex and backreferences, and it doesn't seem to want to work very well. I'm sure it's something I'm doing wrong but I can't figure out what...

 import re
 mystring = r"This is \n a test \r"
 p = re.compile( "\\\\(\\S)" )
 p.sub( "\\1", mystring )
'This is n a test r'
 p.sub( "\\\\\\1", mystring )
'This is \\n a test \\r'
 p.sub( "\\\\1", mystring )
'This is \\1 a test \\1'


I'd like to replace \\[char] with \[char], but backreferences in Python don't appear to follow the same rules they do in every other implementation I've ever used. Could someone shed some light?
