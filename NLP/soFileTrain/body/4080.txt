What code analysis tools do you use on your Java projects?

I am interested in all kinds


static code analysis tools (FindBugs, PMD, and any others)
code coverage tools (Cobertura, Emma, and any others)
any other instrumentation-based tools 
anything else, if I'm missing something


If applicable, also state what build tools you use and how well these tools integrate with both your IDEs and build tools. 

If a tool is only available a specific way (as an IDE plugin, or, say, a build tool plugin) that information is also worth noting.
