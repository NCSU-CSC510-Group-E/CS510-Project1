In my example below I'm using a dijit.form.DateTextBox:

input type="text" name="startDate" dojoType="dijit.form.DateTextBox" constraints="{datePattern:'MM/dd/yyyy'}"  value='c:out value="${sessionScope.adminMessageForm.startDate}"/' /


So for example, if the user starts to enter "asdf" into the date the field turns yellow and a popup error message appears saying The value entered is not valid.. Even if I remove the constraints="{datePattern:'MM/dd/yyyy'}" it still validates.  

Without going into details as to why, I would like to be able keep the dojoType and still prevent validation in particular circumstances.
