This gets the value of whatever is selected in my dropdown menu.

document.getElementById('newSkill').value


I cannot however find out what property to go after for the text that's currently displayed by the drop down menu. I tried "text" then looked at W3Schools but that didn't have the answer, does anybody here know?

For those not sure, here's the HTML for a drop down box.

select name="newSkill" id="newSkill"
    option value="1"A skill/option
    option value="2"Another skill/option
    option value="3"Yet another skill/option
/select
