Searching for some sample code for converting a point in WGS84 coordinate system to a map position in Google Maps (pixel position), also supporting zoom levels. 

If the codes is well commented, then it can also be in some other language.

You can also point me to a open source Java project :)

Some resources found:

OpenLayer implementation. 

JOSM project

Excellent Java Map Projection Library  from JH LABS. This is a pure java PROJ.4 port. Does projection from WGS84 to meters. From there it's quite straightforward to convert meters to tile pixels.
