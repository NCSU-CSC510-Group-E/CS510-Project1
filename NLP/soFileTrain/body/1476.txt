How do you express an integer as a binary number with Python literals?

I was easily able to find the answer for hex:

 0x12AF
4783
 0x100
256


and octal:

 01267
695
 0100
64


How do you use literals to express binary in Python?



Summary of Answers


Python 2.5 and earlier: can express binary using int('01010101111',2) but not with a literal.
Python 2.5 and earlier: there is no way to express binary literals.
Python 2.6 beta: You can do like so: 0b1100111 or 0B1100111.
Python 2.6 beta: will also allow 0o27 or 0O27 (second character is the letter O) to represent an octal.
Python 3.0 beta: Same as 2.6, but will no longer allow the older 027 syntax for octals.
