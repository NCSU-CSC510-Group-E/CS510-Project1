I have a Windows 2008 Server (x64) running Microsoft SQL 2008 (x64) and I'm creating a Linked Server connection to an Oracle server.  I'm able to make the connection, but I cannot see any information regarding which schema a table belongs to.

In SQL 2005, my linked servers show the schema information as I would expect.

Does anyone know how to resolve this issue?  Is it an issue with the provider, OraOLEDB.Oracle?

Any help or pointers would be appreciated.
