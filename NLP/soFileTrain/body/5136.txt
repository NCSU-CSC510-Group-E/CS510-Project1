A researcher has created a small simulation in MATLAB and we want to make it accessible to others. My plan is to take the simulation, clean up a few things and turn it into a set of functions. Then I plan to compile it into a C library and use SWIG to create a Python wrapper. At that point I should be able to call the simulation from a small Django app. At least I hope so.

Do I have the right plan? Has anyone else done something similar? Can you let me know if there are any serious pitfalls that I'm not aware of at the moment?
