I just get the beach ball all day long (it's been doing nothing for hours). It's not taking CPU, not reading from disk, not using the network.

I'm using Java 1.6 on Mac OS X 10.5.4. It worked once, now even restarts of the computer won't help. Activity Monitor says it's "(Not Responding)". Only thing that I can do is kill -9 that sucker.

When I sample the process I see this:

    mach_msg_trap        16620
    read        831
    semaphore_wait_trap        831


An acceptable answer that doesn't fix this would include a url for a decent free Oracle client for the Mac.

Edit:
@Mark Harrison sadly this happens every time I start it up, it's not an old connection. I'll like to avoid running Windows on my laptop. I'm giving some plugins for my IDE a whirl, but still no solution for me.
@Matthew Schinckel Navicat seems to only have a non-commercial Oracle product...I need a commercial friendly one (even if it costs money).
