If you're building an AJA~Xy app, are there any downsides to using JSONP requests/responses even if you're not planning on any cross-domain requests? 

The only thing I can think of is that there are a couple extra bytes for the callback wrapper... 

Edit:

I found this which also suggests security and error handling as potential problems... 


  There's no error handling. The script injection either works, or it doesn't.
  If there's an error from the injection, it'll hit the page, and short of a window wide error handler (bad, bad, very bad), you need to be sure the return value is valid on the server side.


I don't think error handling is much of a problem... most of us would use a library to generate the JSON... the well-formedness of my response isn't a concern for this question.

and security:


  There's documents out on the web that can help, but as a cursory check, I would check the referrer in the server side script.


it seems like this is a potential problem with any type of response... certainly there's nothing unique to JSONP in the security arena...?
