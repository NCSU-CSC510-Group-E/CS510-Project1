I'd like some sorthand for this:

Map rowToMap(row) {
    def rowMap = [:];
    row.columns.each{ rowMap[it.name] = it.val }
    return rowMap;
}


given the way the GDK stuff is, I'd expect to be able to do something like:

Map rowToMap(row) {
    row.columns.collectMap{ [it.name,it.val] }
}


but I haven't seen anything in the docs... am I missing something? or am I just way too lazy?
