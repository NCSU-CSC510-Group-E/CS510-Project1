I'm trying to use jQuery to format code blocks, specifically to add a pre tag inside the code tag:

$(document).ready(function() {
$("code").wrapInner("pre/pre");
});


Firefox applies the formatting correctly, but IE puts the entire code block on one line. If I add an alert  

alert($("code").html());


I see that IE has inserted some additional text into the pre tag:

PRE jQuery1218834632572="null"


If I reload the page, the number following jQuery changes.

If I use wrap() instead of wrapInner(), to wrap the pre outside the code tag, both IE and Firefox handle it correctly. But shouldn't pre work inside code as well?

I'd prefer to use wrapInner() because I can then add a CSS class to the pre tag to handle all formatting, but if I use wrap(), I have to put page formatting CSS in the pre tag and text/font formatting in the code tag, or Firefox and IE both choke. Not a huge deal, but I'd like to keep it as simple as possible.

Has anyone else encountered this? Am I missing something?
