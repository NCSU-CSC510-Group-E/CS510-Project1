I'm working on a website which will switch to a new style on a set date. The site's built in semantic HTML and CSS, so the change should just require a CSS reference change. I'm working with a designer who will need to be able to see how it's looking, as well as a client who will need to be able to review content updates in the current look as well as design progress on the new look.

I'm planning to use a magic querystring value and / or a javascript link in the footer which writes out a cookie to select the new CSS page. We're working in ASP.NET 3.5. Any recommendations?

I should mention that we're using IE Conditional Comments for IE8, 7, and 6 support. I may create a function that does a replacement:

link href="Style/% GetCssRoot() %.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /
!--[if lte IE 8]
    link type="text/css" href="Style/% GetCssRoot() %-ie8.css" rel="stylesheet" /
![endif]--
!--[if lte IE 7]
    link type="text/css" href="Style/% GetCssRoot() %-ie7.css" rel="stylesheet" /
![endif]--
!--[if lte IE 6]
    link type="text/css" href="Style/% GetCssRoot() %-ie6.css" rel="stylesheet" /
![endif]--
