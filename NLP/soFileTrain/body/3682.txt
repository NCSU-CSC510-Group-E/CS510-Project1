I have a MySQL table with approximately 3000 rows per user. One of the columns is a datetime field, which is mutable, so the rows aren't in chronological order.

I'd like to visualize the time distribution in a chart, so I need a number of individual datapoints. 20 datapoints would be enough.

I could do this:

select timefield from entries where uid = ? order by timefield;


and look at every 150th row.

Or I could do 20 separate queries and use limit 1 and offset. 

But there must be a more efficient solution...
