I created a view on a machine using the substring function from Firebird, and it worked.  When I copied the database to a different machine, the view was broken.  This is the way I used it:

SELECT SUBSTRING(field FROM 5 FOR 15) FROM table;


And this is the output on the machine that does not accept the function:

token unknown:  FROM


Both computers have this configuration:


IB Expert version 2.5.0.42 to run the queries and deal with the database.
Firebird version 1.5 as server to database.
BDE Administration version 5.01 installed, with Interbase 4.0 drivers.


Any ideas about why it's behaving differently on these machines?
