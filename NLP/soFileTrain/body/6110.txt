I've been handed a table with about 18000 rows. Each record describes the location of one customer. The issue is, that when the person created the table, they did not add a field for "Company Name", only "Location Name," and one company can have many locations.

For example, here are some records that describe the same customer:

Location Table

 ID  Location_Name     
 1   TownShop#1        
 2   Town Shop - Loc 2 
 3   The Town Shop     
 4   TTS - Someplace   
 5   Town Shop,the 3   
 6   Toen Shop4        


My goal is to make it look like:

Location Table

 ID  Company_ID   Location_Name     
 1   1            Town Shop#1       
 2   1            Town Shop - Loc 2 
 3   1            The Town Shop     
 4   1            TTS - Someplace   
 5   1            Town Shop,the 3   
 6   1            Toen Shop4        


Company Table

 Company_ID  Company_Name  
 1           The Town Shop 


There is no "Company" table, I will have to generate the Company Name list from the most descriptive or best Location Name that represents the multiple locations.

Currently I am thinking I need to generate a list of Location Names that are similar, and then and go through that list by hand.

Any suggestions on how I can approach this is appreciated.

@Neall, Thank you for your statement, but unfortunately, each location name is distinct, there are no duplicate location names, only similar. So in the results from your statement "repcount" is 1 in each row.

@yukondude, Your step 4 is the heart of my question.
