To analyze lots of text logs I did some hackery that looks like this:


Locally import logs into Access 
Reprocess Cube link to previous mdb in Analisis Service 2000 (yes it is 2k)
Use Excel to visualize Cube (it is not big - up to milions raw entries)


My hackery is a succes and more people are demanding an access to my Tool. As you see I see more automating and easier deployment.

Do you now some tools/libraries that would give me the same but with easier deployment?
Kind of embedded OLAP service?

Edit: I heard of Mondrian but we don't do much with Java. Have you seen something similiar done for .Net/Win32 ? Comercial is also OK.
