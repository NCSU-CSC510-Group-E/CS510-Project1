I am having some trouble with the Google Maps API. I have an array which holds a ojbect I created to store points.

My array and class:

var tPoints = [];    
function tPoint(name) {
        var id = name;
        var points = [];
        var pointsCount = 0;
        ...
        this.getHeadPoint = function() { return points[pointsCount-1]; }
    }


tPoint holds an array of GLatLng points. I want to write a function to return a GLatLngBounds object which is extended from the current map bounds to show all the HeadPoints.

Heres what I have so far..

function getBounds() {
    var mBound = map.getBounds();
    for (var i = 0; i  tPoints.length; i++) {
        alert(mBound.getSouthWest().lat() + "," + mBound.getSouthWest().lng());
        alert(mBound.getNorthEast().lat() + "," + mBound.getNorthEast().lng());
            currPoint = trackMarkers[i].getHeadPoint();        
            if (!mBound.containsLatLng(currPoint)) {
                mBound.extend(currPoint);
            }
        }
    return mBound;
}


Which returns these values for the alert. (Generally over the US)


  "19.64258,NaN" "52.69636,NaN" "i=0"
  "19.64258,NaN" "52.69636,-117.20701" "i=1"


I don't know why I am getting NaN back.
When I use the bounds to get a zoom level I think the NaN value is causing the map.getBoundsZoomLevel(bounds) to return 0 which is incorrect. Am I using GLatLngBounds incorrectly?
