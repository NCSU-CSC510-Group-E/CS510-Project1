I have an absolutely positioned div that I want to show when the user clicks a link. The onclick of the link calls a js function that sets the display of the div to block (also tried: "", inline, table-cell, inline-table, etc). This works great in IE7, not at all in every other browser I've tried (FF2, FF3, Opera 9.5, Safari).

I've tried adding alerts before and after the call, and they show that the display has changed from none to block but the div does not display.

I can get the div to display in FF3 if I change the display value using Firebug's HTML inspector (but not by running javascript through Firebug's console) - so I know it's not just showing up off screen, etc.

I've tried everything I can think of, including:


Using a different doctype (XHTML 1, HTML 4, etc)
Using visibility visible/hidden instead of display block/none
Using inline javascript instead of a function call
Testing from different machines


Any ideas about what could cause this?
