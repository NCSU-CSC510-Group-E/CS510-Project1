When I try to print a Unicode string in a Windows console, I get a UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character .... error.  I assume this is because the Windows console does not accept Unicode-only characters. What's the best way around this? Is there any way I can make Python automatically print a ? instead of failing in this situation?

Edit:  I'm using Python 2.5.
