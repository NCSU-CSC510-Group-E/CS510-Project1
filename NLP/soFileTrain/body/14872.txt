Anyone seen this before? 


  CREATE DATABASE permission denied in database 'master'.
  An attempt to attach an auto-named database for file 
  C:\Documents and Settings\..\App_Data\HelloWorld.mdf failed. 
  A database with the same name exists, or specified file cannot be
  opened, or it is located on UNC share.


I'm asking on a friend's behalf. I've sent him these links:
