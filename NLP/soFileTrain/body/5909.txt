I'm downloading an entire directory from a web server. It works OK, but I can't figure how to get the file size before download to compare if it was updated on the server or not. Can this be done as if I was downloading the file from a FTP server?

import urllib
import re

url = "http://www.someurl.com"

# Download the page locally
f = urllib.urlopen(url)
html = f.read()
f.close()

f = open ("temp.htm", "w")
f.write (html)
f.close()

# List only the .TXT / .ZIP files
fnames = re.findall('^.*a href="(\w+(?:\.txt|.zip)?)".*$', html, re.MULTILINE)

for fname in fnames:
    print fname, "..."

    f = urllib.urlopen(url + "/" + fname)

    #### Here I want to check the filesize to download or not #### 
    file = f.read()
    f.close()

    f = open (fname, "w")
    f.write (file)
    f.close()




@Jon: thank for your quick answer. It works, but the filesize on the web server is slightly less than the filesize of the downloaded file. 

Examples:

Local Size  Server Size
 2.223.533  2.115.516
   664.603    662.121


It has anything to do with the CR/LF conversion?
