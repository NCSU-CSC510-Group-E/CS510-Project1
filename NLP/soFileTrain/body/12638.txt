So basically I'm building an app for my company and it NEEDS to be built using MS Access and it needs to be built on SQL Server.

I've drawn up most of the plans but am having a hard time figuring out a way to handle the auditing system.

Since it is being used internally only and you won't even be able to touch the db from outside the building we are not using a login system as the program will only be used once a user has already logged in to our internal network via Active Directory.  Knowing this, we're using a system to detect automatically the name of the Active Directory user and with their permissions in one of the DB tables, deciding what they can or cannot do.

So the actual audit table will have 3 columns (this design may change but for this question it doesn't matter); who (Active Directory User), when (time of addition/deletion/edit), what (what was changed)

My question is how should I be handling this.  Ideally I know I should be using a trigger so that it is impossible for the database to be updated without an audit being logged, however I don't know how I could grab the Active Directory User that way.  An alternate would be to code it directly into the Access source so that whenever something changes I run an INSERT statement.  Obviously that is flawed because if something happens to Access or the database is touched by something else then it will not log the audit.

Any advice, examples or articles that may help me would be greatly appreciated!
