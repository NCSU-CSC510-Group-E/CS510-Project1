FCKeditor has InsertHtml API (JavaScript API document) that inserts HTML in the current cursor position. How do I insert at the very end of the document?

Do I need to start browser sniffing with something like this

if ( element.insertAdjacentHTML )    // IE 
    element.insertAdjacentHTML( 'beforeBegin',  html ) ; 
else                                // Gecko 
{ 
    var oRange = document.createRange() ; 
    oRange.setStartBefore( element ) ; 
    var oFragment = oRange.createContextualFragment( html ); 
    element.parentNode.insertBefore( oFragment,  element ) ; 
} 


or is there a blessed way that I missed?

Edit: Of course, I can rewrite the whole HTML, as answers suggest, but I cannot believe that is the "blessed" way. That means that the browser should destroy whatever it has and re-parse the document from scratch. That cannot be good. For example, I expect that to break the undo stack.
