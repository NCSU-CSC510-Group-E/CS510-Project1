Suppose we have a table A:

itemid mark
1      5
2      3


and table B:

itemid mark
1      3
3      5


I want to join A*B on A.itemid=B.itemid both right and left ways. i.e. result:

itemid A.mark B.mark
1      5      3
2      3      NULL
3      NULL   5


Is there a way to do it in one query in MySQL?
