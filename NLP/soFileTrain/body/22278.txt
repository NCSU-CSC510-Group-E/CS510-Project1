Most of my experience is on the MSFT stack, but I am now working on a side project, helping someone with a personal site with cheap hosting that is built on the LAMP stack.  My options for installing extras are limited, so I'm wondering about how to write my data access code without embedding raw queries in the .php files.

I like to keep things simple, even with .NET.  I generally write stored procedures for everything, and I have a helper class that wraps all calls to execute procedures and return data sets.  I'm not looking for a full-blown ORM, but it might be the way to go and others who view this question might be looking for that.  

Remember that I'm on a $7/month GoDaddy account, so I'm limited to what's already installed in their basic package.

Edit: Thanks rix0rr, Alan, Anders, dragon, I will check all of those out. I edited the question to be more open to ORM solutions, since they are so popular.
