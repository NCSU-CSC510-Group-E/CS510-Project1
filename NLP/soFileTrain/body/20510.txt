I have a flex application that needs the ability to generate and execute JavaScript. When I say this, I mean I need to execute raw JavaScript that I create in my Flex application (not just an existing JavaScript method)

I am currently doing this by exposing the following JavaScript method:

function doScript(js){ eval(js);}


I can then do something like this in Flex (note: I am doing something more substantial then an alert box in the real Flex app):

ExternalInterface.call("doScript","alert('foo'));


My question is does this impose any security risk, I am assuming it's not since the Flex and JasvaScript all run client side...

Is there a better way to do this?
