I have a table with a structure like the following:

------------------------------
LocationID     | AccountNumber
------------------------------
long-guid-here | 12345
long-guid-here | 54321


To pass into another stored procedure, I need the XML to look like this:

root 
    clientID12345/clientID
    clientID54321/clientID
/root


The best I've been able to do so far was getting it like this:

root clientID="10705"/


I'm using this SQL statement:

SELECT
    1 as tag,
    null as parent,
    AccountNumber as 'root!1!clientID'
FROM
    Location.LocationMDAccount
WHERE
    locationid = 'long-guid-here'
FOR XML EXPLICIT


So far, I've looked at the documentation on the MSDN page, but I've not come out with the desired results.



@KG,

Yours gave me this output actually:

root
  Location.LocationMDAccount
    clientId10705/clientId
  /Location.LocationMDAccount
/root


I'm going to stick with the FOR XML EXPLICIT from Chris Leon for now.
