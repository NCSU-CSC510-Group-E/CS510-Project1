What are some strategies that people have had success with for maintaining a change history for data in a fairly complex database. One of the applications that I frequently use and develop for could really benefit from a more comprehensive way of tracking how records have changed over time. For instance, right now records can have a number of timestamp and modified user fields, but we currently don't have a scheme for logging multiple change, for instance if an operation is rolled back. In a perfect world, it would be possible to reconstruct the record as it was after each save, etc.

Some info on the DB:


Needs to have the capacity to grow by thousands of records per week
50-60 Tables
Main revisioned tables may have several million records each
Reasonable amount of foreign keys and indexes set
Using PostgreSQL 8.x
