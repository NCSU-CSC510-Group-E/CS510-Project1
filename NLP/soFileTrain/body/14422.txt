For example, http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/pyobjc.html is still for OS X 10.4 Tiger, not 10.5 Leopard.. And that's the official Apple documentation for it..

The official PyObjC page is equally bad, http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/

It's so bad it's baffling.. I'm considering learning Ruby primarily because the RubyCocoa stuff is so much better documented, and there's lots of decent tutorials (http://www.rubycocoa.com/ for example), and because of the Shoes GUI toolkit..

Even this badly-auto-translated Japanese tutorial is more useful than the rest of the documentation I could find..

All I want to do is create fairly simple Python applications with Cocoa GUI's..
Can anyone shed light on the horrible documentation, or point me at some tutorials that don't just give you huge blocks of code and assume you know what NSThread.detachNewThreadSelector_toTarget_withObject_("queryController", self, None) does..?
