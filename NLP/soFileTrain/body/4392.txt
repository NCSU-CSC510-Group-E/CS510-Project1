In the past few months I began my first serious JavaScript development, as I began developing XUL applications.  I use Notepad++ as my editor, but I was pretty appalled to find (as far as I can tell) that Venkman/Javascript Debugger is the tool for debugging.  It seems like a poor replacement to Visual Studio for .Net languages.

Am I missing something?  What are the best tools and best practices for JavaScript development?  Is there some killer IDE/debugger/editor combination I'm not aware of?  

It has to be easier than this, though.

I've heard some mention of Eclipse - is it a good choice here? I know very little about it.

Edit:  Some of you have pointed out Firebug - I guess my problem was that I'm not actually using JavaScript for web development for which Firebug seems to be the tool -- instead I'm using it for XUL development in xulrunner.  Which may simply be a weakness or immaturity of xulrunner.
