What options are there in the industry for enterprise reporting?  I'm currently using SSRS 2005, and know that there is another version coming out with the new release of MSSQL.

But, it seems like it might also be a good time to investigate the market to see what else is out there.

What have you encountered?  Do you like it/dislike it? Why?

Thank you.
