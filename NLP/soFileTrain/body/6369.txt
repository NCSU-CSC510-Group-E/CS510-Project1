So I have a Sybase stored proc that takes 1 parameter that's a comma separated list of strings and runs a query with in in an IN() clause:

CREATE PROCEDURE getSomething @keyList varchar(4096)
AS
SELECT * FROM mytbl WHERE name IN (@keyList)


How do I call my stored proc with more than 1 value in the list?
So far I've tried 

exec getSomething 'John'         -- works but only 1 value
exec getSomething 'John','Tom'   -- doesn't work - expects two variables
exec getSomething "'John','Tom'" -- doesn't work - doesn't find anything
exec getSomething '"John","Tom"' -- doesn't work - doesn't find anything
exec getSomething '\'John\',\'Tom\'' -- doesn't work - syntax error


EDIT: I actually found this page that has a great reference of the various ways to pas an array to a sproc
