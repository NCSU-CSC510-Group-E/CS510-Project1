The company I just started working for is using Stripes for parts of its web page development these days, and while it seems to be a nice enough web framework it no one really uses it-- it is almost non existent on the 'net. It's not even first in it's google search and the result you do get is for its old home page.

So, do any of you people use Stripes? Of your own volition? Do you know of any good tutorials / examples?
