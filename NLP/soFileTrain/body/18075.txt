I haven't really done a ton of database work in a few years and have become unaccustomed with the tools available.  Back a few years ago I was working with oracle databases and was using primarily TOAD with a little bit of MS Access as my tools of choice to prototype the queries I was using in my applications.  I really loved TOAD in that it was super intuitive and really easy to use and I'm hoping to find something similar for MS SQL Server. Something open source or free is preferable, since I doubt my client will want to pay for anything, but I'm willing to hear suggestions of things that cost money if they are far and away the best in class tool available.
