I've got two models: Message and Attachment. Each attachment is attached to a specific message, using a ForeignKey on the Attachment model. Both models have an auto_now DateTimeField called updated. I'm trying to make it so that when any attachment is saved, it also sets the updated field on the associated message to now. Here's my code:

def save(self):
    super(Attachment, self).save()
    self.message.updated = self.updated


Will this work, and if you can explain it to me, why? If not, how would I accomplish this?
