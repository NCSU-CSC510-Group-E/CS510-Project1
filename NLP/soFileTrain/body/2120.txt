I want to get the MD5 Hash of a string value in SQL Server 2005. I do this with the following command:

SELECT HashBytes('MD5', 'HelloWorld')


However, this returns a VarBinary instead of a VarChar value. If I attempt to convert 0x68E109F0F40CA72A15E05CC22786F8E6 into a VarChar I get há ðô§*à\Â'†øæ instead of 68E109F0F40CA72A15E05CC22786F8E6.

Is there any SQL-based solution?

Yes
