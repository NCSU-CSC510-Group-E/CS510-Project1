Two users wanted to share the same database, originally written in MS Access, without conflicting with one another over a single MDB file.

I moved the tables from a simple MS Access database to MySQL using its Migration Toolkit (which works well, by the way) and set up Access to link to those tables via ODBC.

So far, I've run into the following:


You can't insert/update/delete rows in a table without a primary key (no surprise there).
AutoNumber fields in MS Access must be the primary key or they'll just end up as integer columns in MySQL (natch, why wouldn't it be the PK?)
The tables were migrated to MySQL's InnoDB table type, but the Access relationships didn't become MySQL foreign key constraints.


Once the database is in use, can I expect any other issues? Particularly when both users are working in the same table?
