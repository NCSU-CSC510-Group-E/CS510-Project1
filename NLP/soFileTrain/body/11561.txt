I've used Apache CXF to expose about ten java classes as web services.

I've generated clients using CXF, Axis, and .NET.

In Axis and CXF a "Service" or "Locator" is generated. 
From this service you can get a "Port".
The "Port" is used to make individual calls to the methods exposed by the web service.

In .NET the "Service" directly exposes the calls to the web service.

Can someone explain the difference between a port, a service, a locator, and an endpoint when it comes to web services?

Axis:

PatientServiceImplServiceLocator locator = 
    new PatientServiceImplServiceLocator();
PatientService service = locator.getPatientServiceImplPort();


CXF:

PatientServiceImplService locator = new PatientServiceImplService();
PatientService service = locator.getPatientServiceImplPort();


.net:

PatientServiceImplService service = new PatientServiceImplService();
