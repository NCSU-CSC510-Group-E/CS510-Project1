I have a custom validation function in JavaScript in a user control on a .Net 2.0 web site which checks to see that the fee paid is not in excess of the fee amount due. 

I've placed the validator code in the ascx file, and I have also tried using Page.ClientScript.RegisterClientScriptBlock() and in both cases the validation fires, but cannot find the JavaScript function.

The output in Firefox's error console is "feeAmountCheck is not defined". Here is the function (this was taken directly from firefox->view source)

script type="text/javascript"
    function feeAmountCheck(source, arguments)
    {
        var amountDue = document.getElementById('ctl00_footerContentHolder_Fees1_FeeDue');
        var amountPaid = document.getElementById('ctl00_footerContentHolder_Fees1_FeePaid');

        if (amountDue.value  0  amountDue = amountPaid)
        {
            arguments.IsValid = true;
        }
        else
        {
            arguments.IsValid = false;
        }

        return arguments;
    }
/script


Any ideas as to why the function isn't being found? How can I remedy this without having to add the function to my master page or consuming page?
