I want to be able to make an HTTP call updating some select boxes after a date is selected. I would like to be in control of updating the textbox so I know when there has been a "true" change (in the event the same date was selected). Ideally, I would call a function to pop-up the calendar and be able to evaluate the date before populating the text box...so I can do my validation before making a server call.
