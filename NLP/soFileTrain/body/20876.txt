I'm new to SQL Server Reporting Services, and was wondering the best way to do the following:


  
  Query to get a list of popular IDs
  Subquery on each item to get properties from another table
  


Ideally, the final report columns would look like this:

[ID] [property1] [property2] [SELECT COUNT(*)
                              FROM AnotherTable 
                              WHERE ForeignID=ID]


There may be ways to construct a giant SQL query to do this all in one go, but I'd prefer to compartmentalize it. Is the recommended approach to write a VB function to perform the subquery for each row? Thanks for any help.
