I'm looking for a Java library for SWIFT messages. I want to


parse SWIFT messages into an object model
validate SWIFT messages (including SWIFT network validation rules)
build / change SWIFT messages by using an object model


Theoretically, I need to support all SWIFT message types. But at the moment I need MT103+, MT199, MT502, MT509, MT515 and MT535.

So far I've looked at two libraries


AnaSys Message Objects (link text)
Datamation SWIFT Message Suite (link text)


Both libraries allow to accomplish the tasks mentioned above but in both cases I'm not really happy. 

AnaSys uses a internal XML representation for all SWIFT messages which you need to know in order to access the fields of a message. And you need to operate on the DOM of the XML representation, there is no way to say "get the contents of field '50K' of the SWIFT message".

And the Datamation library seems to have the nicer API but does not find all errors.

So does anyone know other SWIFT libraries to use?
