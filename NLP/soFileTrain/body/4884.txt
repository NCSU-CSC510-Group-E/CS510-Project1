I need help finishing my custom built ajax [div] based dynamic dropdown. 

Basically, I have an [input] box which; onkeyup, runs an Ajax search which returns a bunch of results in divs and are drawn back in using innerHTML. These divs all have highlights onmouseover so, a typical successful search yields the following structure (pardon the semi-code):

[input]
 [div id=results] //this gets overwritten contantly by my AJAX function
  [div id=result1 onmouseover=highlight onclick=input.value=result1]
  [div id=result2 onmouseover=highlight onclick=input.value=result2]
  [div id=result2 onmouseover=highlight onclick=input.value=result2]
 [/div]


It works.. beautifully! looks elegant and is way more complete than any regular dropdown (those results div bring in a lot of information).

However, I'm missing the most of important functions behind regular HTML elements, that is, I can't keyboard down or up between "options". How do I do this? I know javascript handles keyboard events but; I haven't been able to find a good guide on how to do this. (Of course, the follow up question to this will eventually end up being: can I use ENTER to trigger that onclick event?)
