Here is a simplification of my database:

Table: Property
Fields: ID, Address

Table: Quote
Fields: ID, PropertyID, BespokeQuoteFields...

Table: Job
Fields: ID, PropertyID, BespokeJobFields...

Then we have other tables that relate to the Quote and Job tables individually.

I now need to add a Message table where users can record telephone messages left by customers regarding Jobs and Quotes.

I could create two identical tables (QuoteMessage and JobMessage), but this violates the DRY principal and seems messy.

I could create one Message table:

Table: Message
Fields: ID, RelationID, RelationType, OtherFields...

But this stops me from using constraints to enforce my referential integrity.  I can also forsee it creating problems with the devlopment side using Linq to SQL later on.

Is there an elegant solution to this problem, or am I ultimately going to have to hack something together?
