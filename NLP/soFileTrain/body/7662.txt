Whenever I design a database, I always wonder if there is a best way of naming an item in my database. Quite often I ask myself the following questions:


Should table names be plural?
Should column names be singular?
Should I prefix tables or columns?
Should I use any case in naming items?


Are there any recommended guidelines out there for naming items in a database?
