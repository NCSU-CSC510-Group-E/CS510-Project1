I want to convert a primitive to a string, and I tried:

myInt.toString();


This fails with the error:

int cannot be dereferenced


Now, I get that primitives are not reference types (ie, not an Object) and so cannot have methods.  However, Java 5 introduced autoboxing and unboxing (a la C#... which I never liked in C#, but that's beside the point).  So with autoboxing, I would expect the above to convert myInt to an Integer and then call toString() on that.

Furthermore, I believe C# allows such a call, unless I remember incorrectly.  Is this just an unfortunate shortcoming of Java's autoboxing/unboxing specification, or is there a good reason for this?
