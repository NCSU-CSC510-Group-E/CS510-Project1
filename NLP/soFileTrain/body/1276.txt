At what point does a MySQL database start to lose performance?


Does physical database size matter?
Do number of records matter?
Is any performance degradation linear or exponential?


I have what I believe to be a large database, with roughly 15M records which take up almost 2GB. Based on these numbers, is there any incentive for me to clean the data out, or am I safe to allow it to continue scaling for a few more years?
