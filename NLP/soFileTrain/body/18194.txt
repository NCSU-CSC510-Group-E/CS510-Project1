So I'm getting a new job working with databases (Microsoft SQL Server to be precise).  I know nothing about SQL much less SQL Server.  They said they'd train me, but I want to take some initiative to learn about it on my own to be ahead.  Where's the best place to start (tutorials, books, etc)?  I want to learn more about the SQL language moreso than any of the fancy point and click stuff.
