I don't know when to add to a dataset a tableadapter or a query from toolbox. Does it make any difference?

I also dont know where to create instances of the adapters. 


Should I do it in the Page_Load? 
Should I just do it when I'm going to use it?  
Am I opening a new connection when I create a new instance?


This doesn't seem very important, but every time I create a query a little voice on my brain asks me these questions.
