 import time
 time.strptime("01-31-2009", "%m-%d-%Y")
(2009, 1, 31, 0, 0, 0, 5, 31, -1)
 time.mktime((2009, 1, 31, 0, 0, 0, 5, 31, -1))
1233378000.0
 60*60*24 # seconds in a day
86400
 1233378000.0 / 86400
14275.208333333334


time.mktime should return the number of seconds since the epoch. Since I'm giving it a time at midnight and the epoch is at midnight, shouldn't the result be evenly divisible by the number of seconds in a day?
