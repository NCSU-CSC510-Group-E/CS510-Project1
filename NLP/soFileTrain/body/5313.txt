I learned Swing back in the day but now I've moved to Python and want to make some apps with GUIs. I haven't had the time to learn a new GUI API so I've been using Jython, but I would prefer to use CPython. 

It would be great if I can have one simple markup that allows me to switch GUI libraries. It would be even better if I can use the same markup language across languages so I can quickly make GUIs for any language I'm using. Does anyone know of such a markup/library?

I've seen markups like Glade and wxWidget's markup (I forget the name). They're partly what I'm looking for (making a GUI without coding it in a language) but they're intertwined with a specific library. And neither are really nice looking or friendly to human editting.
