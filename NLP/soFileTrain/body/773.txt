I haven't been able to find an understandable explanation of how to actually use Python's itertools.groupby() function.  What I'm trying to do is this:


Take a list - in this case, the children of an objectified lxml element
Divide it into groups based on some criteria
Then later iterate over each of these groups separately.


I've reviewed the documentation, and the examples, but I've had trouble trying to apply them beyond a simple list of numbers. 

So, how do I use of itertools.groupby()?  Is there another technique I should be using?  Pointers to good "prerequisite" reading would also be appreciated.
