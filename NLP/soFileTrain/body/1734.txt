I was just looking through some information about Google's protocol buffers data interchange format.  Has anyone played around with the code or even created a project around it?

I'm currently using XML in a Python project for structured content created by hand in a text editor, and I was wondering what the general opinion was on Protocol Buffers as a user-facing input format.  The speed and brevity benefits definitely seem to be there, but there are so many factors when it comes to actually generating and processing the data.
