I did some tests a while ago and never figured out how to make this work.  

The ingredients:


COM+ transactional object (developed in VB6)  
.Net web application (with transaction) in IIS that...
makes a call to the COM+ component
updates a row in a SQL database


Testing:  

Run the .Net application and force an exception.  

Result:  

The update made from the .Net application rolls back.
The update made by the COM+ object does not roll back.

If I call the COM+ object from an old ASP page the rollback works.

I know some people may be thinking "what?! COM+ and .Net you must be out of your mind!", but there are some places in this world where there still are a lot of COM+ components. I was just curious if someone ever faced this and if you figured out how to make this work.
