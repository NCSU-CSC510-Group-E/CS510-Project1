If I have data like this:

+---+----+
|Key|Name|
+---+----+
|1  |Dan |
+---+----+
|2  |Tom |
+---+----+
|3  |Jon |
+---+----+
|4  |Tom |
+---+----+
|5  |Sam |
+---+----+
|6  |Dan |
+---+----+


What is the SQL query to bring back the records where Name is repeated 2 or more times?

So the result I would want is

 +---+
 |Tom|
 +---+
 |Dan|
 +---+
