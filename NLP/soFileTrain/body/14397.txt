Currently we have a project with a standard subversion repository layout of:

./trunk
./branches
./tags

However, as we're moving down the road of OSGi and a modular project, we've ended up with:

./trunk/bundle/main
./trunk/bundle/modulea
./trunk/bundle/moduleb
./tags/bundle/main-1.0.0
./tags/bundle/main-1.0.1
./tags/bundle/modulea-1.0.0

The 'build' is still quite monolithic in that it builds all modules in sequence, though I'm starting to wonder if we should refactor the build/repository to something more like:

./bundle/main/trunk
./bundle/main/tags/main-1.0.0
./bundle/main/tags/main-1.0.1
./bundle/modulea/trunk
./bundle/modulea/tags/modulea-1.0.0  

In this pattern I would imagine each module building itself, and storing its binary in a repository (maven, ivy, or another path of the subversion repository itself).

Are there guidelines or 'best-practices' over project layouts once one goes modular?
