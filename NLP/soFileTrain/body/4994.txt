I am currently creating a master ddl for our database.  Historically we have used backup/restore to version our database, and not maintained any ddl scripts.  The schema is quite large.

My current thinking:


Break script into parts (possibly in separate scripts):


table creation
add indexes
add triggers
add constraints

Each script would get called by the master script.
I might need a script to drop constraints temporarily for testing
There may be orphaned tables in the schema, I plan to identify suspect tables.


Any other advice?

Edit: Also if anyone knows good tools to automate part of the process, we're using MS SQL 2000 (old, I know).
