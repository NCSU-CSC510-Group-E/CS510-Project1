I have a need to convert images from CMYK to RGB - not necessarily back again, but hey, if it can be done...

With the release of ColdFusion 8, we got the CFImage tag, but it doesn't support this conversion; and nor does Image.cfc, or Alagad's Image Component.

However, it should be possible in Java; which we can leverage through CF. For example, here's how you might create a Java thread to sleep a process:

cfset jthread = createObject("java", "java.lang.Thread")/
cfset jthread.sleep(5000)/


I would guess a similar method could be used to leverage java to do this image conversion, but not being a Java developer, I don't have a clue where to start. Can anyone lend a hand here?
