Python uses the reference count method to handle object life time. So an object that has no more use will be immediately destroyed.

But, in Java, the GC(garbage collector) destroys objects which are no longer used at a specific time.

Why does Java choose this strategy and what is the benefit from this?

Is this better than the Python approach?
