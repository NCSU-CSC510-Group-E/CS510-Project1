I know in javascript Objects double as hashes but i have been unable to find a built in function to get the keys 

var h = {a:'b',c:'d'};


I want something like 

var k = h.keys() ; // k = ['a','c'];


It is simple to write a function myself to iterate over the items and add the keys to an array that I return, but is there a standard cleaner way to do that?

I keep feeling it must be a simple built in function that I missed but I can't find it!
