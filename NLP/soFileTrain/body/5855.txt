I've found many sources that talk about the automated Eclipse PDE process.  I feel these sources don't do a good job explaining what's going on.

I can create the deployable package, in a semi-manual process via the Feature Export.  

The automated process requires knowledge of how the org.eclipse.pde.build scripts work.  I have gotten a build created, but not for JNLP.

Questions:


Has anyone ever deployed RCP through JNLP?
Were you able to automate the builds?
