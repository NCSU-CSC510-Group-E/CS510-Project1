I have a website that plays mp3s in a flash player. If a user clicks 'play' the flash player automatically downloads an mp3 and starts playing it. 

Is there an easy way to track how many times a particular song clip (or any binary file) has been downloaded?




  Is the play link a link to the actual
  mp3 file or to some javascript code
  that pops up a player?
  
  If the latter, you can easily add your
  own logging code in there to track the
  number of hits to it.
  
  If the former, you'll need something
  that can track the web server log
  itself and make that distinction. My
  hosting plan comes with webalizer,
  which does this nicely.


It's javascript code, so that answers that. 

However, it would be nice to know how to track downloads using the other method (without switching hosts).
