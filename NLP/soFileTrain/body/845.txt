Suppose I have the following CSS rule in my page:

body {
    font-family: Calibri, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}


How can I detect which one of the defined fonts was used in the user's browser?

Edit for people wondering why I want to do this: The font I'm detecting contains glyph's that are not available in other fonts and when the user does not have the font I want to display a link asking the user to download that font so they can use my web application with the correct font.

Currently I am displaying the download font link for all users, I want to only display this for people who do not have the correct font installed.
