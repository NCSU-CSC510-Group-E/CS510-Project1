I am about to build a piece of a project that will need to construct and post an XML document to a web service and I'd like to do it in Python, as a means to expand my skills in it.  

Unfortunately, whilst I know the XML model fairly well in .NET, I'm uncertain what the pros and cons are of the XML models in Python.  

Anyone have experience doing XML processing in Python? Where would you suggest I start? The XML files I'll be building will be fairly simple.
