First of all, I know how to build a Java application. But I have always been puzzled about where to put my classes. There are proponents for organizing the packages in a strictly domain oriented fashion, others separate by tier.

I myself have always had problems with 


naming, 
placing


So,


Where do you put your domain specific constants (and what is the best name for such a class)?
Where do you put classes for stuff which is both infrastructural and domain specific (for instance I have a FileStorageStrategy class, which stores the files either in the database, or alternatively in database)?
Where to put Exceptions?
Are there any standards to which I can refer?
