I've been making a concerted effort to improve my javascript skills lately by reading as much javascript code as I can. In doing this I've sometimes seen the javascript: prefix appended to the front of event handler attributes in HTML element tags. What's the purpose of this prefix? Basically, is there any appreciable difference between:

onchange="javascript: myFunction(this)"


and

onchange="myFunction(this)"


?
