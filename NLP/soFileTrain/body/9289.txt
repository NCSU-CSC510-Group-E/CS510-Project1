I would like to filter an array of items by using the map() function. Here is a code snippet:

var filteredItems = items.map(function(item)
{
    if( ...some condition... )
    {
        return item;
    }
});


The problem is that filtered out items still uses space in the array and I would like to completely wipe them out.

Any idea?

EDIT: Thanks, I forgot about filter(), what I wanted is actually a filter() then a map().

EDIT2: Thanks for pointing that map() and filter() are not implemented in all browsers, although my specific code was not intended to run in a browser.
