I have seen two ways of implementing DAO-DVO design.

1) DVO are objects and DAOs are instantiated using factories i.e DAOs are also objects
2) DVOs are again objects but in this case, DAOs are classes which contain only static methods which accept DVOs to perform tasks.

I was wondering which way is better and more scalable.
