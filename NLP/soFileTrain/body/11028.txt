When I'm joining three or more tables together by a common column, I'd write my query like this:

SELECT *
FROM   a, b, c
WHERE  a.id = b.id
AND    b.id = c.id


a colleague recently asked my why I didn't do explicit Join Transitive Closure in my queries like this:

SELECT *
FROM   a, b, c
WHERE  a.id = b.id
AND    b.id = c.id
AND    c.id = a.id


are the really any advantages to this? Surely the optimiser can imply this for itself?

edit: I know it's evil syntax, but it's a quick and dirty example of legitimate legacy code +1 @Stu for cleaning it up
