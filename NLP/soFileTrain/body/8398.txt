I just saw this mentioned in StackOverflow question Best WYSIWYG CSS editor and didn't know it could be done. I'm a Visual Studio newbie, so how do you do it?

Is there a separate debugger for JavaScript? I know how to work the one for code-behind pages...  I usually use Firebug to deal with debugging JavaScript code.

I'm using VisualStudio2005.
