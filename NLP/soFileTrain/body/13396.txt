I love list comprehensions in Python, because they concisely represent a transformation of a list.

However, in other languages, I frequently find myself writing something along the lines of:

foreach (int x in intArray)
  if (x  3) //generic condition on x
    x++ 
    //do other processing


This example is in C#, where I'm under the impression LINQ can help with this, but is there some common programming construct which can replace this slightly less-than-elegant solution?  Perhaps a data structure I'm not considering?
