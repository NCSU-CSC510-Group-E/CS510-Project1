This problem started on a different board, but Dave Ward, who was very prompt and helpful there is also here, so I'd like to pick up here for hopefully the last remaining piece of the puzzle.­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­

Basically, I was looking for a way to do constant updates to a web page from a long process. I thought AJAX was the way to go, but Dave has a nice article about using JavaScript. I integrated it into my application and it worked great on my client, but NOT my server WebHost4Life. I have another server @ Brinkster and decided to try it there and it DOES work. All the code is the same on my client, WebHost4Life, and Brinkster, so there's obviously something going on with WebHost4Life.

I'm planning to write an email to them or request technical support, but I'd like to be proactive and try to figure out what could be going on with their end to cause this difference. I did everything I could with my code to turn off Buffering like Page.Response.BufferOutput = False. What server settings could they have implemented to cause this difference? Is there any way I could circumvent it on my own without their help? If not, what would they need to do?

For reference, a link to the working version of a simpler version of my application is located @ http://www.jasoncomedy.com/javascriptfun/javascriptfun.aspx and the same version that isn't working is located @ http://www.tabroom.org/Ajaxfun/Default.aspx. You'll notice in the working version, you get updates with each step, but in the one that doesn't, it sits there for a long time until everything is done and then does all the updates to the client at once ... and that makes me sad.
