I'm having issues with my SQL Reporting Services reports. I'm using a custom font for report headers, and when deployed to the server it does not render correctly when I print or export to PDF/TIFF. I have installed the font on the server. Is there anything else I need to do in order to use custom fonts?

When viewing the font in the browser it looks correct - since all client computers have the font installed...



Thanks Ryan, your post to the FAQ solved the problem. Installing the fonts on the server fixes the print problem, as well as problems with charts (which are also rendered on the server). Like you point out (as well as being mentioned in the FAQ) Reporting Services 2005 does not do font embedding in PDF files. I guess that is okay for now - the most important part was being able to hit print and get the correct fonts.

The reason the fonts didn't show up straight away is answered in the FAQ:


  Q: I've installed the font on my client/server but I still see ?'s or
  black boxes. Why? A: For the client
  machine, closing all instances of the
  PDF viewer then reopening them should
  fix the issue.
  
  For the server, restarting the
  services should allow the PDF renderer
  to pick up the new font information.
  
  Unfortunately, I have also seen times
  where I needed a full machine reboot
  to get the client/server to recognize
  the newly installed font.
