I am looking for the best method to run a Java Application as a *NIX daemon or a Windows Service.  I've looked in to the Java Service Wrapper, the Apache Commons project 'jsvc', and the Apache Commons project 'procrun'.  So far, the Java Service Wrapper looks like it's the best option... but, I'm wondering if there are any other "Open Source friendly" licensed products out there.
