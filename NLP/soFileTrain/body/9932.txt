I have an application deployed into multiple zones and there are some issues with opening larger documents (20-50MB) across the WAN.  

Currently the documents are stored in Zone 1 (Americas) and a link stored in the database to the docs.  

I have heard some things about blobs in oracle and store binary in MS SQL Server 2005 and then perhaps copying the database to other zones.

Any other suggestions or good results with one of the described options?
