How can you reliably and dynamically load a JavaScript file?  This will can be used to implement a module or component that when 'initialized' the component will dynamically load all needed JavaScript library scripts on demand.

The client that uses the component isn't required to load all the library script files (and manually insert script tags into their web page) that implement this component - just the 'main' component script file.

How do mainstream JavaScript libraries accomplish this (Prototype, jQuery, etc)?  Do these tools merge multiple JavaScript files into a single redistributable 'build' version of a script file?  Or do they do any dynamic loading of ancillary 'library' scripts?

An addition to this question: is there a way to handle the event after a dynamically included JavaScript file is loaded?  Prototype has document.observe for document-wide events. Example:

document.observe("dom:loaded", function() {
  // initially hide all containers for tab content
  $$('div.tabcontent').invoke('hide');
});


What are the available events for a script element?
