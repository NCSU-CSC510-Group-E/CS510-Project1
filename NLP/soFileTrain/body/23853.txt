I am using Struts + Velocity in a Java application, but after I submit a form, the confirmation page (Velocity template) shows the variable names instead an empty label, like the Age in following example:


  Name: Fernando
  
  Age: {person.age}
  
  Sex: Male


I would like to know how to hide it!
