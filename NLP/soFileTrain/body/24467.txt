I'm developing a web- application using NHibernate. Can you tell me how to write a NHibernate Query for the following SQL query:

SELECT v1.Id
FROM VIEW v1
LEFT JOIN VIEW v2 ON v1.SourceView = v2.Id
ORDER BY v1.Position


It's basically a auto-join but I don't know how to write this in Nhibernate. Lets say the property names are the same as the table column names.
