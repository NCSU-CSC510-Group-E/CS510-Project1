I am trying to generate a report by querying 2 databases (Sybase) in classic ASP.

I have created 2 connection strings:


  connA for databaseA
  connB for databaseB


Both databases are present on the same server (don't know if this matters)

Queries:


  q1 = SELECT column1 INTO #temp FROM databaseA..table1 WHERE xyz="A"
  q2 = SELECT columnA,columnB,...,columnZ FROM table2 a #temp b WHERE b.column1=a.columnB


followed by:


  response.Write(rstsql) 
  set rstSQL = CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset")
  rstSQL.Open q1, connA
  rstSQL.Open q2, connB


When I try to open up this page in a browser, I get error message:


  Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e37'
  
  [DataDirect][ODBC Sybase Wire Protocol driver][SQL Server]#temp not found. Specify owner.objectname or use sp_help to check whether the object exists (sp_help may produce lots of output). 


Could anyone please help me understand what the problem is and help me fix it?

Thanks.
