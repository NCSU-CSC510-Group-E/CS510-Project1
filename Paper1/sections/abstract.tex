\begin{abstract}
Choosing a textbook is something that many professors do several times a year, but given the vast number of available textbooks for any given subject, making a choice that meets the needs of a class and is economical to students is difficult.  
In this paper, we propose two methods for automatically learning topics from books and propose a system that will use those methods in a system that attempts to suggest textbooks to a professor that balance hitting all topics the course requires while still being economical for students.
