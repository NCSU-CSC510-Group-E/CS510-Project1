\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Anticipated challenges}
% We anticipate there being problems in setting up Doc2Vec
% We do not have NLP expertise on our group's staff, so we will need to consult with TAs and do extra research.  

\subsection{Tentative schedule}
% This section needs to provide a simple table with week breakdowns of tasks with the condition 
% that we are still planning and researching and the schedule will change.
\subsection{Future enhancement}
One major enhancement would be the introduction of a rating system to the suggestion engine.  
Another major enhancement would be including links in the UI to buy the books.
A third major enhancement would be evaluating other topic modeling algorithms to see how they stack up.
Another enhancement would be to test an even more rudimentary topic modeling method, such as simply representing topics as lines in a table of contents.  
Essentially asking the question of whether or not fancy algorithms are even more useful that simple text search for this domain.
