\section{Evaluation Plan}
This is a test of our evaluation plan section 

\subsection{Evaluating Topic Modeling}
%i.	Surveying?
%ii.	Build a UI to present a book and a topic that was thought to be in the book
%iii.	User validates yes/no
%iv.	We use that feedback to tweak parameters of our models and to identify how many iterations of training we need to do (both our algorithms improve with more iterations)


\subsection{Evaluating textbook suggestions}
%i.	Surveying?
%ii.	User selects topics they want to search for
%iii.	App presents 3 answers: 
%1.	an expensive but complete solution,
%2.	an inexpensive but incomplete solution,
%3.	a middle-of-the-road solution
%iv.	User identifies if the solutions are reasonable
%v.	User is presented with more (how many) books that did not make the cut, and is asked if one of those should have been in the top 3.
