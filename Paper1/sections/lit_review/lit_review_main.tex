\section{Literature Review} \label{section:algorithms}
We propose two methods for analyzing and storing topics from books automatically: LDA and Doc2vec. 

\subsection{LDA}
% This algorithm seems to be the clear winner.  

% Conceptually, this algorithm one-hot-encodes its input like Doc2vec does

% It then uses prior probabilities to identify words that are commonly paired with the given word.

% Through repeated training on the same data set, it will gradually identify topics among related text.

\subsection{Doc2Vec}
Doc2Vec is a model that extends an existing model, Word2Vec.  
Doc2vec mirrors Word2Vec in most ways except that it adds context information. \cite{RefWorks:doc:5a6e5748e4b0d609eec798dd}
% I'm not sure this algorithm really fits and shouldn't be replaced with something like LSI... see notes.  

% conceptually, this algorithm takes in a one-hot encoded vector and attempts to train a two-layer neural network to predict words around n-grams given.

% After iterations of training, it will give you a cluster of words that are similar to the given word.

% I guess we'd have to put something on top of Doc2Vec to use it for topic modeling.  I'm not entirely clear on how we'd do that.
