\section{Proposed Solution} 
To tackle this problem, we propose a three-part system that will go about recommending books via a web app.  
The first component of this system is a recommendation engine, which will implement the above algorithms in some way and store their results (the topics) in an indexed database which we can summarily search.  
The next component will be a recommendation engine which will implement our recommendation algorithm (see below for more details).  
The third component will be a web app that will allow the end-user to search the database of topics and organize them into a useful search of books.  
It will then present a list of suggested books using the infrastructure mentioned earlier.
