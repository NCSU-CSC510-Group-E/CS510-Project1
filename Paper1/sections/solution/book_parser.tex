The first major component of the system is the book parser.  
We intend to implement this taking advantage of the pre-built libraries available in Python such as SKLearn, Pandas, and others.  
The goal of the book parser is to implement one of the two algorithms discussed in section \ref{section:algorithms} and to store the parsed topics in a database for searching later.  
This will be implemented using the command pattern, which provides a simple interface to implementing different algorithms in code and allows us to easily swap between implementations.
% TODO: Can we decide on a few and list them here somehow?
The books being parsed will come from a freely available online database of textbooks.  
It is also our intention to cache the topics parsed from these algorithms somehow (either in a database or in a flat file somewhere) to be referenced in the future.  
This will allow us to train the algorithms on the books ahead of time and will make searching for books based on topics much more efficient.
