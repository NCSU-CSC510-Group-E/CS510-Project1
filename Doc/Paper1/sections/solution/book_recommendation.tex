The next step in our problem is to use the topic analysis data outlined in the previous section (\ref{section:book-parser}) to suggest books based on the topics covered and the cost.
This algorithm will be written in Python as well.  

Conceptually, this algorithm will need to take in a set of required topics and weighting for topics vs price.
This value will be used to favor inexpensive books over complete topic coverage in our algorithm.
It will then search its algorithms for books that meet the required topics.
The algorithm should then rank the books using the weighting mentioned earlier, then it will sort some number of the top results and give them back to the UI.
