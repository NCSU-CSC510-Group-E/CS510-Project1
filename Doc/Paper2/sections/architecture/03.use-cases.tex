% What use cases do we intend to support?
The team envisions fairly few use cases for the proposed system, as
the system's scope is fairly well defined.
The system recommends textbooks to users based on the textbook cost
and the topics covered in that textbook.
With that very limited scope in mind, the webapp needs to support
three use-cases documented in table \ref{sec:use-cases:table}

\begin{table*}[h]
  \centering
  \caption{Use Cases}
  \begin{tabular}{l p{5cm}}
    \bf USER & \bf TASK \\ \hline \\
    Professor & Search for textbooks with a given set of topics \\
    Professor & Search for textbooks with a given set of topics using
                an increased weight on providing an inexpensive
                textbook \\
    Professor & Search for textbooks with a given set of topics using
                an increased weight on matching all topics requested 
  \end{tabular} \label{sec:use-cases:table}

\end{table*}
