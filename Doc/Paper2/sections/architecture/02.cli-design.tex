% Introduce the where this topic fits in the previous discussion
The NLP algorithms are the focus of most of the rest of this paper.
To make it easier to test and evaluate these algorithms, the team
designed a CLI using the Python package Click.
Once the CLI was up and running, the learning algorithms were
implemented using the package Gensim.
Wrapper classes around the Gensim models were built using a variant of
the strategy pattern, so that our implementations could easily be
swapped back and forth during testing.
