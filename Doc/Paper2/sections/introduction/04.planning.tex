The prototypes the team identified for this project are listed in
table \ref{sec:planning:prototypes-table}.
% Talk about what the most risky parts of the project are.
The team identified the learning algorithms as the most risky part of
the project, primarily because of the team's lack of experience
with natural language processing algorithms.  

% Go into why these things are risky
As discussed before, these algorithms have succesfully been used to
mine topics for some time, but the particular problem of identifying
the topics in textbooks for search recommendations is fairly novel.
This process requires a data set that matches up well with the desired
% TODO: fill in section
topics, which will come into play in Section \ref{sec:validation}.

% mention briefly the problem of evaluating the models created, and
% point ahead to when we'll talk about that more
One other major point of risk is developing the Doc2Vec model.
The Gensim API contains a Doc2Vec model but it does not expose parts
of the API to make the clusters directly available, which is expanded

\paragraph{Timeline}
The team completely had to re-evalaute the sechedule to accomodate the
prototypes desired in table \ref{sec:planning:prototypes-table}.
The team intended to iterate every week, attempting to finish one
prototype each week on the way around the spiral model.
This often worked, and prototypes 1, 2, and 3 were finished in the
first three weeks of the project.
Prototypes 3 and 4 were develoed in parallel over the last several
weeks of the project and were followed immedaitely by implementing
the evaluation plan in section \ref{sec:validation}.
