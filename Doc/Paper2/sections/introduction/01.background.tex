One of the most basic tasks that a professor must do is identify what textbook to use for a given class.
While some fields have textbooks that have become popular and are
clearly the best in their subject matter, many fields (especially
emerging ones) have no such exemplar and reading through all possible
candidates would be too time consuming to be feasible.  
It would be a complex enough problem if there were not already a
massive number of textbooks on sources such as Amazon, but self aware
professors have attempted to use textbooks that are less expensive
with hopes of allowing lower income students to attend more easily.  
This admirable intention serves to increase the already considerable
time needed to find appropriate books, and there is no obvious
heuristic to apply to searches to limit the field.  

In the interests of making students lives less expensive, have 
expored a system which can identify topics in books automatically, and
which, given a set of requirements from a user (our intention is for
the system to be used by a professor, but others may find value in it),
can suggest options of varying expense and completeness for a given set of topics.  
To do this, we propose exploring word clusters generated by Doc2Vec, a
family of common natural language processing (NLP) algorithms that
attempt to cluster similar words, and topics generated by latent
dirichlet allocation (LDA), another common NLP algorithm that directly
attempts  to identify topics in text, to automatically infer the
content of a set of textbooks.  

We then intend to build a web app that will allow a user to specify a
set of topics and which will use the mentioned algorithms to make
suggestions while minimizing the cost of said textbooks.  
The actual web app will be a fairly simple single-page web app
developed in Angular4 and using Bootstrap to hasten development of a modern UI.  

The team begain this experiment somewhat biased toward LDA as the
algorithm expected to perform, and this initial bias turned out to be
more or less correct.
After spending significant time training and validating a useful
Doc2Vec model, the team was unable to build a useful topic mining
algorithm on top of Doc2Vec.
