    \begin{tabular}{ l c }
    \bf Week started & \bf Task \\ \hline \\
    1-2 & Front-end webapp  \\

The team's first attempt at scheduling out the project was focused on
using agile methodology.  
The overall architecture was broken down into components that could be
designed and the work was scheduled for two week sprints.
This schedule is shown in Table
\ref{sec:devi-from-init-pln:original-timeline}.
The intent was to develop the NLP algorithms, suggestion engine, and
web app in parallel as much as was possible, resulting in a fully
developed web-app at the end of the project.
The original hope was that the algorithms themselves would be fairly
straightforward to work with and that it would be possible to apply
re-usable algorithms easily and quickly to develop what was needed.

\paragraph{Challenges}
It became apparent very quickly that this schedule was not going to
work.
The team's experience (summarized in table
\ref{sec:devi-from-init-pln:skillsets} with data mining generally and
machine learning more specifically was not up to par.
While the team had some experience in software engineering, the
specific NLP tasks that were required took more time and effort than
was anticpated, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:planning}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \caption{Developer Skills (years)}
    \begin{tabular}{ l c l l}
    \bf Name & \bf Data mining & \bf Programming & \bf NLP\\ \hline \\
    Zach DeLong & 1 & 5 & 0 \\
    Monica Metro &  0 & 0 & 0 \\
    Zhangqi Zha & 0 & 2 & 0\\
    Bikram & ? & ? & ?  
    \end{tabular} \label{sec:devi-from-init-pln:skillsets}
\end{table}

After the project was broken into the above sprints, the team realized
they lacked the expertise to split the work up this way and the
decision was made to organize the project differently with the
intention of producing a smaller subset of the original goal with more
fully fleshed out functionality.
