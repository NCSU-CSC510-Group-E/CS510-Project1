\subsection{Future enhancement}
The problem of textbook suggestion is fairly general and lends itself well to a number of different directions.
We would like to start this app off with a fairly limited set of functionality, just the suggestions and a link to the FOSS library holding the book in question, but enhancements such as amazon integration would be 
One major enhancement would be the introduction of a rating system to the suggestion engine.  
Another major enhancement would be including links in the UI to buy the books.
A third major enhancement would be evaluating other topic modeling algorithms to see how they stack up, such as IDA.
Another enhancement would be to test an even more rudimentary topic modeling method, such as simply representing topics as lines in a table of contents.  
Essentially asking the question of whether or not fancy algorithms are
even more useful that simple text search for this domain.
